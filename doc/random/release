  - add it to Makefile.am
  - update list of features by going through the ChangeLog
  - update list of bugs fixed by pasting in the output of:
    moap doap bug query -f "<bug><id>%(id)s</id><summary>%(summary)s</summary></bug>" milestone=0.2.0

  - update list of contributors
* copy the generated text version to the RELEASE file
* Edit NEWS and add the tickets fixed for this milestone, as well as the
  new features
  (if this is a new major/minor stable series, list features for the whole
   development cycle, not since last dev release, as users are typically
   upgrading from the previous stable series)
