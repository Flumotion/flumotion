This module does logging.

Suggested use in your project:

- create myproject/extern directory
- svn propset svn:externals "log https://core.fluendo.com/svn/flumotion/trunk/flumotion/extern/log" myproject/extern
- in your project:
  - call log.init('MY_PROJECT_DEBUG')
    (where MY_PROJECT_DEBUG is the name of the enviroment variable you want
     to have the debug output controlled by)
  - call log.setPackageScrubList('myproject')
    to have the filename logging be relative to your myproject package/module.
  - call log.setDebug(myDebugString) to change the logging levels.

Alternatively, you can embed only the log.py file with proper svn:externals.

If you are worried about stability, check out a specific revision by
putting -r (revision number) in between log and https
