	  event.
	  Add self._calendar, getCalendar and setCalendar.
	  Remove removeEvent, calendars always keep their events and
	  schedule with instances.
	  Remove replaceEvents.
	  Change subscribe to take functions that notify about instances
	  starting and ending, instead of events.
	  Change the core, getNextEvent, to a function that gets the next
	  points, so that all points at that time get handled, not just
	  one.

	* flumotion/common/eventcalendar.py:
	  Fix bug in getActiveInstances where it was ignoring events with
	  a RECURRENCE-ID that should specialize the rrule.
	  Switch to UTC for interpreting tz-less dates, since most likely
	  a file with no tz information will not magically happen to be
	  in the same time zone as the server that will run the component.
	  Add a new Calendar object to collect the EventSets parsed from

	  Make clipping getPoints to start and end optional, because
	  you don't want asking the Calendar for points to be clipping.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  When stopping explicitly, create a deferred. Fire it once shutdown is
	  complete. Return it from remote stop method.

2007-12-28  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	  Raise an exception rather than silently returning if we fail to stop a
	  lost component when the worker says it's still running.

	(VolumeAdminGtkNode.volumeSet):
	  Ensure that the scale has an adjustment.

2007-12-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/combiners/switch/switch.py
	(collect_single_shot_buffer_probe): New helper, runs a function on
	one buffer from all pads, firing a deferred in the main thread
	when all values are collected.
	(SwitchMedium.remote_switchTo): New remote method.
	(ICalSwitchPlug, Switch.do_setup): Factor ICal stuff out into a
	plug, which currently is not exported as such, but in the future
	could be.
	(Switch.init): Rework the state of the switcher, and document it.
	Going back to the idealEater formulation that Zaheer had. Removed
	lock, unnecessary as all switch code happens in the main thread.
	(Switch.clearWarning): New helper.
	(Switch.is_active): Less evil.
	(Switch.eaterSetActive): Don't muck with a dict of deferreds; the
	idea is just to retry switching as necessary.
	(Switch.switch_to): Rework to set the idealEater and then call
	try_switch().
	(Switch.try_switch): Put prepare() and finish() code inside, which
	I hope is more readable. The diff sucks tho.

	the same. Add more debugging.
	(ManagerComponentState.clearJobState): Add more logic from
	manager/component.py, clearing out any messages proxied from the
	job state, and setting the mood to sleeping or lost, depending on
	whether the logout was forseen or not.

2007-11-13  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	  Use maybeDeferred properly. Not sure how this worked previously.
	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	  Add remote expireKeycard method (as in httpstreamer), so that explicit
	  keycard expiry will cause client disconnection as intended.

	  Implement waiting for clients to disconnect and loggers to complete
	  logging on shutdown, so we log properly on shutdown.

2007-11-13  Johan Dahlin  <johan@flumotion.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	Continue to refactor all the code in the callbacks

	alias for failUnlessFailure

	* flumotion/commmon/test_*.py: Use testsuite.TestCase, fix imports

	(FeedMap._recalc): Fix.

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py
	(BaseAdminGtk.gettext_domain): Set to None instead of 'flumotion'
	so that we hit the non-translated codepath; otherwise some kind of
	error makes us not add the feeders and eaters tabs.
	(BaseAdminGtk.setup.fetchTranslations): Assume that gettext_domain
	is there, an interface that checks for an attr is pretty bad.
	Instead check if it is None.

2007-11-12  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/plugs/loggers.py:
	  Logger plug can now optionally return a deferred from event handlers.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	  Rename a variable that was shadowing an import that we were then trying
	  to use.
	* flumotion/component/effects/volume/volume.py:
	  If we have an invalid value in the list, change the value in the list
	  rather than in a local variable that we then discard. Fixes #792.
	* flumotion/component/producers/soundcard/soundcard.py:
	  Update for component API changes.

2007-11-08  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	  BaseAdminGtkNode.haveWtree, BaseAdminGtkNode.loadGladeFileErrback,
	  BaseAdminGtkNode.renderFinished,
	  BaseAdminGtkNode.renderFinishedErrback, BaseAdminGtkNode.addMessage):
	  This should teach me to fix code being refactored.
	  Handle errors in component UI code better.
	  Don't put anything in the UI (except for debug info) that is
	  not translated.
	  Put error messages in the message area where they belong, and add
	  a method for it to do it consistently.

2007-11-07  Johan Dahlin  <johan@flumotion.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py (Window.help_about_cb):

	Move over AboutDialog to dialogs.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py (Window.debug_reload_all_cb):

2007-11-07  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (FeedMap.__init__)
	(FeedMap.componentAttached, FeedMap.componentDetached)
	(FeedMap.getFeederAvatar, FeedMap._recalc): Add a new dataset,
	virtualfeeddeps, which is the set of components that should be
	reconnected when one virtual feed provider logs out. As a separate
	change, treat virtualFeeds purely as a cache -- don't manage it in
	attached()/detached().
	(FeedMap.getEatersForFeeders): Make documentation match intent.
	(FeedMap.__init__, FeedMap.componentDetached)
	(FeedMap.getFeederAvatar, FeedMap._recalc): s/virtual//, we manage
	all feeds generically now. Yay.

	(FeedMap.__init__, FeedMap.componentAttached)
	(FeedMap.componentDetached, FeedMap._recalc)
	(FeedMap.getEatersForFeeders): Use dictlists for virtualFeeds,

	the return of getFeedersForEaters.
	(FeedMap.__init__, FeedMap.componentAttached)

	can restore the logging options set before we modify them.

2007-11-07  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentAvatar.getWorker):
	Remove, there was already getWorkerName.
	(ComponentHeaven.feedServerAvailable): Fix crack.
	(FeedMap): Factor getEatersForFeeders and getFeedersForEaters into
	a separate object -- will allow some memoization opportunities.

	feedMap.
	(ComponentAvatar.onShutdown): Notify the heaven on logout so that
	it can e.g. reconnect other components that eat from virtual
	feeds.
	(ComponentHeaven.componentAttached): Take the avatar directly.
	Change some warnings into asserts.
	(ComponentHeaven.componentDetached): New function. Notify the feed
	map, and reconnect any components that need to be reconnected.

2007-11-07  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	  Import fcntl in global scope as well. There's no reason to do this
	  locally, and it's somewhat of a hot path (client connection).

2007-11-07  Johan Dahlin  <johan@flumotion.com>

	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	* flumotion/common/config.py:
	Avoid importing locale in a non-global scope, should help us
	avoid some locking. Also only modify LC_NUMERIC on 2.3 since
	PEP 331 went into 2.4.

2007-11-07  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	  Throttle uiState updates in the streamer.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am:

	* flumotion/manager/depgraph.py: Removed, no more users. Add back
	when we decide that we need more complexity?

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentHeaven.mapNetFeed): Fix
	poor implementation of the last changeset; allow a None toPort to
	just fall through.
	(ComponentHeaven._getFeedersForEaters)
	(ComponentHeaven._getFeederAvatar): Factor out the process of
	mapping a feedId to an avatar/feedName pair into another method.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentHeaven.mapNetFeed):
	Instead of raising TryAgain on failure, debug and return None,
	None.
	(ComponentHeaven._connectEatersAndFeeders.connect): Handle a
	mapNetFeed failure with a nice debug statement.
	(ComponentHeaven._connectEatersAndFeeders): Remove TryAgain foo.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentHeaven._getFeedersForEaters)
	(ComponentHeaven._getEatersForFeeders)
	(ComponentHeaven._connectEatersAndFeeders): It's not possible to
	have what we used to call a "detached avatar", due to the ordering
	in the cleanup() function in Vishnu.requestAvatar(), so remove
	those code paths. Note that getEatersForFeeders is suboptimal.

2007-11-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentHeaven._connectEatersAndFeeders): Coalesce
	_connectEaters, _connectEaterUpstream, _connectFeeders, and

	(ComponentHeaven.getComponentAvatarForState): Removed, no callers.
	(TryAgain): An exception for local use.
	(ComponentAvatar.feedTo, ComponentAvatar.eatFrom): More debug.
	(ComponentAvatar.getFullFeedId): New function.
	(ComponentAvatar.provideMasterClock): Call masterClockAvailable in
	the case where the clock has already been provided, it's just a
	component logging in again.
	(ComponentAvatar.onShutdown): Fold the mood functions in here,
	they are not public and may only be called in certain
	circumstances.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu.workerAttached): Unhappily,
	the worker is not in the avatars dict at this point, so
	callLater(0) on a function that requires it to be there. Boo.
	Maybe fix later.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentHeaven._getEatersForFeeders)
	(ComponentHeaven._getFeedersForEaters): Moved here, off of the
	component avatar.

	feeds support to loadComponent().

2007-11-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	Add concept of "virtual feeds" to component configuration; a
	component can provide a number of "virtual feeds", which in the
	future will be used by the manager to provide failover between
	separate components.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (buildVirtualFeeds): New helper
	procedure.

       Refactor command-line parsing to use a base class which
       provides the common options and optinally uses GOption if
       we use a sufficiently new pygobject.
       Ignore optparse in pychecker since we're not interested in bugs
       in the standard library.

2007-11-05  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	defer generator. See #385.
	(AdminModel.getEntry): Removed this defgen, it has no more

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu._componentStopNoAvatar)
	(Vishnu._componentStopWithAvatar, Vishnu.componentStop): Split the

	* flumotion/test/test_component_bouncers_component.py
	(TrivialBouncerTest.setKeycardExpireInterval): Fondle the bouncer

	bouncer.py.

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/bouncer.py (Bouncer): Expire
	keycards every 2 minutes instead of every 60. Makes memory usage
	more stable.

	(Bouncer.expireKeycardId): Use a Poller instead of rolling our

	* flumotion/test/bouncertest.py
	(TrivialBouncerTest.setKeycardExpireInterval): Use private API to
	set the expirer timeout. Hacky, but hey.

2007-11-02  Johan Dahlin  <johan@flumotion.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/dialogs.py (PropertyChangeDialog): Use show()
	on all individual items instead of show_all() once.

	* flumotion/component/effects/volume/volume.glade: Change the
	shortcut for changing the volume from C to V, C is already used

	(EaterPadMonitor.setInactive, EaterPadMonitor.setActive)
	(EaterPadMonitor.detach): When the eater monitor is inactive,
	periodically reconnect using another poller. Fixes bug whereby the
	monitor would only attempt to reconnect once.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentAvatar.perspective_reservePortsOnWorker): Removed, it
	had no callers. Fixes #745.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponentMedium.remote_callMethod): Removed, it had no

	medium that defines the appropriate remote_* method.

2007-10-30  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/padmonitor.py (PadMonitor): Refactor to use
	the Poller. Incidentally fixes #788, and a bug whereby downstream
	components would not attempt to reconnect to a missing upstream
	component.
	(PadMonitor.detach): Fix. Yay previously-written test suites!

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py
	(FeedComponent.eatFromFD): No need to try to start the pipeline if
	it was already started.

	* flumotion/common/common.py (Poller): New class, abstracts the
	process of a periodically calling a procedure.

2007-10-29  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py
	(FeedComponent.do_setup): try_start_pipeline, not start_pipeline;
	we can't set the pipeline to PLAYING if it has eaters for which we
	have not set fd's. Fixes #782.
	(FeedComponent.install_eater_event_probes): Moved around.
	(FeedComponent._setup_pipeline): Add pad monitors and event probes
	here, before we set the pipeline to PLAYING.
	(FeedComponent.set_master_clock): try_start_pipeline.
	(FeedComponent.try_start_pipeline): Renamed from start_pipeline.
	The eater probes and pad monitors were moved to _setup_pipeline;
	this function only sets the pipeline to PLAYING if the necessary
	conditions are fulfilled.
	(FeedComponent.eatFromFD): Call try_start_pipeline(); with the new
	code, pipelines don't go to PLAYING until all of their eaters are
	connected.

	* flumotion/component/eater.py (Eater.__init__): Add an fd
	attribute, which is None if the eater is disconnected.
	(Eater.connected): Set the uiState and fd directly, because
	connected() is only called from the reactor thread.
	(Eater.disconnected.updateUIState): Null out the fd attribute as
	well.

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py
	(FeedersAdminGtkNode.setUIState): Fix appearance of feeders tab
	when initially selected.

	* flumotion/component/base/feeders.glade:
	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	(FeedersAdminGtkNode.setFeederClientName)
	(FeedersAdminGtkNode.haveWidgetTree): Hacks to allow the feeder
	and eater names to be present at one time. Fixes #540.

2007-10-29  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	  Revert the generic ComponentAdminGtkNode bit that's not done yet.

2007-10-29  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py: Remove unneeded import.

	* flumotion/common/bundleclient.py: Import things more normally,
	now that we don't need to fake out pychecker.
	(BundleLoader.getBundles): Not a defer generator. Don't call
	getBundleZips on an empty set of bundles. Fix some format string
	problems.
	(BundleLoader.loadModule, BundleLoader.getBundleByName)
	(BundleLoader.getFile): Similar de-generatorification.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentAvatar.setElementProperty)
	(ComponentAvatar.getElementProperty)
	(ComponentAvatar.reloadComponent, ComponentAvatar.authenticate)
	(ComponentAvatar.removeKeycardId, ComponentAvatar.expireKeycard):
	Remove references to _mindErrback, which is unnecessary because it
	is handled by mindCallRemote. Fixes #775.

2007-10-28  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/componentview.py:
	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	  Fix translation breakage from [5166]
	* flumotion/component/base/eaters.glade:
	* po/POTFILES.in:
	  Add this file, and use colons like we do in other glade files.
	* configure.ac:
	  Down boy down.

2007-10-26  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Add some comments, move some code from stop() to do_stop(), where it
	  makes more sense.
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Add a debug line.

2007-10-24  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/common/errors.py:
	  New exception for a cancelled operation.
	* flumotion/test/test_defer.py:
	  Tests for new class.
	* flumotion/twisted/defer.py:
	  New class for a exponentially-backing-off retriable deferred.

2007-10-17  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_component_playlist.py:
	  Add a better test for the bug in the playlist fixed yesterday; the
	  test that caught it mostly did so by accident.

2007-10-16  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/common/registry.py:
	  Description attributes can (and sometimes do, in practice) contain
	  characters that need escaping. So, escape them.
	  Fixes cases where some (private) components would cause us to never
	  be able to parse the registry cache.
	* flumotion/test/test_registry.py:
	  Add a test for the above; refactor the dumping tests a little to
	  reduce code duplication.

2007-10-16  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/playlist/playlistparser.py:
	  Make implementation match comments (the comments were correct) when
	  finding the next scheduled item.
	  Fixes problems when adding an item before, but partially overlapping
	  with, the first item in the schedule.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_playlist.py:
	  Add a new test that is fixed by this commit.

2007-10-09  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Fix plug instantiation.

2007-10-08  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/rtsp.py:
	  If our render() deferred errbacks, then respond with an internal
	  server error rather than silently not responding.

2007-10-03  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/soundcard/soundcard.py
	(Soundcard.getVolume): Avoid dividing by 0 if GStreamer reports 0
	channels. Strange, but fixes #715.

	* configure.ac:
	  bump the minor version, this is the crazy development
	  branch

2007-10-03  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentAvatar.__init__)
	(ComponentAvatar.makeComponentState): Set self.componentState
	before calling self.addMessage.

	* flumotion/component/producers/rtsp/rtsp.py
	(Rtsp.get_pipeline_string):
	* flumotion/component/producers/ivtv/ivtv.py
	(Ivtv.get_pipeline_string):
	* flumotion/component/producers/looper/looper.py
	(Looper.get_pipeline_string): Fix naming of feeders.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentAvatar.makeAvatarInitArgs): Revert to previous
	implementation.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponentMedium.remote_getMasterClockInfo): Implement for all
	components, as it seems that all components have clock-master in
	the config.

	* flumotion/common/config.py: Update comment.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentAvatar.makeAvatarInitArgs): Only callRemote to
	getMasterClockInfo if the component has 'clock-master' in its
	config. Slightly hacky, but at least it doesn't assume that all
	components are feed components. Should we just make the base
	Component have a getClockMaster implementation?

	* flumotion/component/feed.py (FeedMedium._doFeedTo): Remove
	monkeypatch, now that we are forcing restarts. See #619.

	* flumotion/launch/main.py:
	* flumotion/launch/parse.py: Fix flumotion-launch, albeit a bit
	hackily. At least clock master selection is more like core now.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.__init__)
	(BaseComponent.__init__, BaseComponent.addMessage): Hackily add
	another error reporting mechanism for programmatically running
	components; probably needs more thought.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu._loadManagerBouncer): Fix
	to conform to init protocol; still seems hacky.

	* flumotion/job/job.py (JobMedium._createComponent): Pass the
	config to createComponent(). No need to setup() any more.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py
	(MultifdSinkStreamer):
	* flumotion/component/producers/unixdomain/unixdomain.py
	(UnixDomainProvider):
	* flumotion/component/producers/playlist/playlist.py
	(PlaylistProducer):
	* flumotion/component/producers/looper/looper.py (Looper): Conform
	to initialization protocol.

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py
	(HTTPFileStreamer): Conform to initialization protocol. Reorder
	some functions.

	* flumotion/component/converters/overlay/overlay.py (Overlay.do_stop):

	* flumotion/component/component.py (maybe_deferred_chain): New
	helper, chains a set of methods.
	(BaseComponent.__init__): Take the component config as an arg. Set
	self.config directly, and run setup() after running init().
	(BaseComponent.init): We can set self.name directly.
	(BaseComponent.do_check): Refactor this base implementation a bit.
	(BaseComponent.do_setup): Do work here that had been done in
	setup(). Fix bugs in the presence of plugs. Chain calls to
	do_check().
	(BaseComponent.setup): No longer take the config, __init__ set it
	already. Push lots of details into the base do_setup(). Go happy
	after the do_setup() chain succeeds, and ensure that messages are
	posted (and the mood changed) on failure.
	(BaseComponent.start): Removed, no longer used.
	(BaseComponent.stop): Chain calls to do_stop(). Push some details
	into the base do_stop().
	(BaseComponent.setMood, BaseComponent.waitForHappy): Add
	infrastructure for getting a deferred that will be fired on ->
	happy; seems a bit hackish. Mostly used by tests and in-process
	manager bouncers. (In-process manager bouncers should probably be
	plugs instead.)

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/component.py (Bouncer.do_setup):
	Rename from do_start.
	(Bouncer.setMedium): Proxy the setMedium to the plug.

	* flumotion/common/common.py (get_all_methods): New public method,
	the guts of call_each_method.

	* flumotion/common/reflectcall.py (createComponent): Take new
	argument, the component config.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_bouncers_bouncer.py
	(TrivialBouncerTest.setUp):

	(TestOldProperties.setUp): Update component __init__.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_init.py (TestInit.testInit): We
	can't successfully __init__ generically any more, now that
	__init__ takes the config. Load the modules anyway though.

	* flumotion/test/comptest.py (ComponentWrapper):
	* flumotion/test/test_comptest.py
	(TestComponentWrapper.test_instantiate_errors)
	(TestComponentWrapper.test_gstreamer_error)
	(TestCompTestSetup.test_success): Update for component init
	protocol changes.

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py
	(FakeWorkerMind.remote_getPorts):
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_worker.py
	(FakeWorkerMind.remote_getPorts): Fix to work with the random port
	change of last week.

2007-10-02  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* doc/random/component-initialization-protocol: Updates. setup()
	is now called directly from __init__, which takes the config dict
	directly. do_check, do_setup, and do_stop methods are
	automatically chained, and do not need to chain up. Start has been
	removed, reflecting the code.

	* doc/random/component-initialization-protocol: Convert to be
	restructured text. No changes.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentAvatar.feedTo)
	(ComponentHeaven._connectFeederDownstream): Updates to pass the
	right thing to callRemote('feedTo', ...).

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py (FeedComponentMedium):
	De-bitrot downsteam connections. Changed the remote call to feedTo
	to be more like eatFrom. Uses the feed medium. Works,
	astonishingly.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_feed.py
	(TestDownstreamFeedClient.testRequestFeed): New test, tests the
	high level 'requestFeed' interface.

	* flumotion/component/feed.py (FeedMedium.requestFeed.error)
	(FeedMedium.sendFeed.error): Propagate the errors to the client;
	avoids successful None returns when the remote feed is not
	available.

2007-10-01  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/job/job.py (JobClientBroker.fileDescriptorsReceived):
	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py (FeedServer.eatFromFD)
	(FeedAvatar._sendFeedReplyCb)
	(FeedAvatar.perspective_receiveFeed, FeedAvatar._doReceiveFeed):
	* flumotion/worker/job.py (ComponentJobAvatar.receiveFeed):
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerBrain.eatFromFD): De-bitrot
	the downstream connection code.

	* flumotion/component/feed.py (FeedMedium.sendFeed): Add stub
	implementation, not tested yet.

	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py (FeedAvatar.eatFromFd)
	* flumotion/test/test_component_feed.py
	(TestDownstreamFeedClient): Add downstream connection tests.
	(TestFeedClient): Refactored common tests to a separate suite.

2007-09-27  Michael Smith <msmith@fluedo.com>

	* flumotion/component/padmonitor.py:
	  If we never receive data in the first timeout period, then go
	  to inactive.

2007-09-27  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	  description should be a string, not a tuple. Remove stray comma.

2007-09-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py
	(FeedComponent.provide_master_clock.pipelinePaused): Get the
	listening port from the time provider.
	(FeedComponent.provide_master_clock.pipelinePaused): Fuck python's
	lexicals!!!!!

	* flumotion/common/worker.py (PortSet.reservePorts): Avoid
	infinite loops.
	(PortSet.__init__): Actually pay attention to the initarg.

	* flumotion/manager/worker.py
	(WorkerAvatar.makeAvatarInitArgs.havePorts)
	(WorkerAvatar.__init__):  New initarg, randomPorts, true if the
	worker will be allocating ports randomly.

	* flumotion/worker/medium.py (WorkerMedium.remote_getPorts):
	Update docs.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerBrain.getPorts): Return a
	pair, the ports and the randomPorts bool.

	* flumotion/common/worker.py (PortSet.__init__): New optional arg,
	randomPorts.
	(PortSet.reservePorts): If we have randomPorts, return 0.

	* flumotion/worker/main.py (_readConfig): Actually respect a
	random=true argument in the worker config.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am
	* flumotion/test/test_worker_config.py
	(WorkerConfigTest.testRandomFeederPorts): New test.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py
	(FeedComponent._setup_pipeline): Set the pipeline to READY even if
	we have a delayed start due to a slaved clock.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerBrain.create.getBundles): Get
	any necessary plug bundles.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponent._instantiate_plugs): New method, factored out of
	setup().
	(BaseComponent.setup): Remove the bundle-fetching behavior of
	setup_plugs, just instantiate the plugs directly now. No more need
	for a registry in components, yay :)

	* flumotion/common/config.py (ConfigEntryPlug.__init__): Make the
	config here directly. Include the module name and entry point so
	that components won't have to load the registry.
	(buildPlugsSet): Take the config generated by the plug.

	* flumotion/test/test_config.py
	(TestConfig.testParseManagerWithPlugs)
	(TestConfig.testParsePlugs)
	(TestConfig.testParsePlugsWithCompoundProperties): Update tests.

	* flumotion/common/reflectcall.py (reflectCall): New method.

	* doc/random/component-initialization-protocol
	(BaseComponent.setup): Change to note that setup is called
	directly by the job.

	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.py
	(Firewire.get_pipeline_string): Fix some of the @feeder@ strings
	for changes on 2007-09-12.

2007-09-26  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_comptest.py
	(TestComponentWrapper.test_setup_and_stop):
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py
	(TestVishnu.testConfigBeforeWorker):
	(TestVishnu.testConfigAfterWorker): Skip these tests for now, will
	get around to fixing them before the release.

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py
	(TestVishnu.testLoadConfiguration)
	* flumotion/test/test_component.py (TestParser):
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_admin.py (TestAdminAvatar):
	* flumotion/test/test_component_httpstreamer.py
	(TestOldProperties.tearDown):
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_worker.py: Update tests.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentAvatar.__init__): Verify/upgrade the config here, at
	initialization time.
	(ComponentAvatar.makeComponentState): New method, taken from
	manager.py's _getComponentState.
	(ComponentAvatar.addMessage, ComponentAvatar.addMessageObject):
	New convenience methods.
	(ComponentAvatar.onShutdown): A lot of the detached() code moved
	here; still, it's a lot of code.
	(ComponentAvatar.provideMasterClock): New method.
	(ComponentAvatar.setClocking): New method, akin to the old
	callRemote('start'), but for clock slaves.
	(ComponentHeaven.feedServerAvailable)
	(ComponentHeaven.masterClockAvailable): Some depgraph-like
	functions. Since eatFrom and provideClockMaster both depend on
	worker port allocations, and workers or the clock master may or
	may not be logged in, we need to react to the comings and goings
	of clock masters.
	(ComponentHeaven._setupClocking): New method, run when a component
	logs in and in some other circumstances; either tells a component
	to provide a master clock, tells it about master clocking info, or
	does nothing if the component is cool without clocking info.
	(ComponentHeaven.componentAttached): When a component logs in,
	tell it about clocking info, and tell it about how to connect its
	eaters and feeders. Should re-fix #721.
	(ComponentHeaven._connectEaterUpstream):
	(ComponentHeaven._connectFeederDownstream): Don't rely on feed
	availability, it's not guaranteed.
	(ComponentHeaven._connectEaters)
	(ComponentHeaven._connectFeeders): Connect all possible eaters and
	feeders, starting the connection from the remote side if
	necessary. A subtle and clever extension that makes arbitrary
	start order possible.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Dispatcher.requestAvatar): Rework
	so that avatars can be constructed with a deferred. Remove the old
	attached/detached behavior. Shortcut past the heavens for creating
	avatars, and managing the heavens' avatar sets.
	(Vishnu): Remove bits about the depgraph. The depgraph was a good
	idea, but in the end was too complicated to be reliable; instead
	by removing some core complications, we remove the need for the
	depgraph.
	(Vishnu.workerAttached.workerAvatarComponentListReceived): Tell
	the component heaven that the feedserverport is available. The
	general idea is good here, but the code intricacies are still
	messy. Pointy boat outside the window.
	(Vishnu.addComponentToFlow): New method, pulled out of the
	component config verification code.
	(Vishnu.registerComponent): New method, pulled out of the
	component config verification code.
	(Vishnu.getWorkerFeedServerPort): Return None if no worker is
	available. Refactoring needed.
	(Vishnu.getComponentMapper): New function, perhaps unnecessary.

	* flumotion/manager/base.py (ManagerAvatar): Refactor so
	that the remote reference is available at __init__-time. Remove
	attached() and unattached(). Use more of the base
	fpb.PingableAvatar.
	(ManagerAvatar.makeAvatarInitArgs): New class method, useful if
	you need to make some remote calls before the avatar can be
	created.
	(ManagerHeaven.createAvatar, ManagerHeaven.removeAvatar): Removed,
	now handled by the dispatcher in manager.py.
	* flumotion/manager/worker.py (WorkerAvatar): Adapt.
	(WorkerAvatar.makeAvatarInitArgs): Get the feed server port and
	port set here.
	* flumotion/manager/admin.py (AdminAvatar):
	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentAvatar)
	(ComponentAvatar.makeAvatarInitArgs): Get the job state, conf, and
	clocking info here, becore making the avatar.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py
	(Vishnu._workerCreateComponentDelayed):
	* flumotion/manager/worker.py (WorkerAvatar.createComponent):
	* flumotion/job/job.py (JobMedium.remote_create)
	(JobMedium._createComponent):
	* flumotion/worker/medium.py (WorkerMedium.remote_create):
	* flumotion/worker/job.py (ComponentJobAvatar.haveMind.create)
	(ComponentJobInfo, ComponentJobHeaven.spawn)
	(ComponentJobHeaven.spawn):
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerBrain.create)
	(WorkerBrain.create.spawnJob): New argument when telling a worker
	to create a component, the component configuration, which is
	passed directly to the job in the create() call, obviating the
	need for the manager->component setup() phase.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.do_pipeline_playing)
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.start_pipeline): Some hacks to get the
	httpstreamer working with the new code. Probably should revise the
	component inititialization protocol.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(FeedComponentMedium.connectEater): Shortcut out if we have not
	yet been informed of the location of the remote feed.
	(FeedComponentMedium.remote_getEaterDetail): Removed, unnecessary.
	(FeedComponentMedium.remote_setMasterClock): New call, proxies
	directly to FeedComponent.set_master_clock().

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py
	(FeedComponent.do_setup): Start the pipeline directly unless we
	are slaving our master clock.
	(FeedComponent._setup_pipeline, FeedComponent.set_master_clock):
	Only disable base_time handling if we are slaving our clock
	remotely. If we are resetting our master clock info, stop then
	start the pipeline; this bit is untested, but then again before it
	failed without errors or warnings, so that's OK. Start the
	pipeline after setting master clock information.
	(FeedComponent.get_master_clock): Since we now overload
	_master_clock_info to be valid in the slaved case as well, only
	return a tuple if we are actually providing a clock master.
	(FeedComponent.provide_master_clock): Since providing a master
	clock can be done with a PLAYING pipeline, don't mess with
	pipeline state here, instead assuming that setup() set the
	pipeline to PLAYING already. Return the existing data if we are
	already providing a master clock.
	(FeedComponent.start_pipeline): Rename from do_start(). Remove
	clocking argument and behavior, that's handled separately.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (remote_setup, remote_start):
	Remove these remote methods. Now, the config passed in setup() is
	instead given from the worker to the job in create(), and the
	clocking info passed in start() is given via the separate
	remote_provideMasterClock/remote_setMasterClock calls. The
	pipeline starts automatically after create(), unless it needs
	master clocking info, in which case it starts after
	setMasterClock().

2007-09-26  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  Set AdminModel logName to the managerId to make log files more
	  comprehensible when there are multiple AdminModels in a process.

2007-09-26  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  Revert r5537, it causes problems.

2007-09-25  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponent.setup.setup_plugs): Only load up the registry if we
	actually have plugs to instantiate. Speeds up component start
	dramatically in the normal case of no plugs.

	Loading the registry should not be necessary at all; the manager
	should give the component all of the information that it needs so
	that it can find the plugs on the local filesystem.

2007-09-20  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/manager/base.py:
	  Update a comment.
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  Rearrange component attach and detach code to be clearer and saner.
	  Remove register/unregister from component heaven.
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  Call avatar.attached() directly from login code, so that we do all
	  this during login, rather than at various later points.
	* flumotion/manager/worker.py:
	  Remove a fixme, raise an exception if a duplicate worker somehow
	  gets into the heaven twice.
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py:
	  Update tests for avatars attaching during login.

	  Fixes #624.

2007-09-18  Arek Korbik  <arkadini@gmail.com>

	* flumotion/admin/command/commands.py (do_avatar_action):
	Do not operate on non-existing components. Fixes #757.

	* flumotion/admin/command/main.py (parse_commands):
	Make command's flow part of the main deferred (and print traceback
	on errors, too). Fixes #727.

2007-09-18  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  Don't emit disconnected from the admin model unless we actually

	New instance var, _clock_slaved. Will be used later.
	(FeedComponent.do_setup): Set _clock_slaved to True if we should
	expect to slave our clock to another one. Call connect_feeders()
	on the pipeline instead of expecting create_pipeline() to do so.
	(FeedComponent.stop_pipeline): Rename from pipeline_stop.
	(FeedComponent.cleanup): It's stop_pipeline now.
	(FeedComponent.do_start): Fix bug in eater pad monitors whereby it

	(FeedComponent.cleanup): Further fixage.

	* flumotion/component/padmonitor.py (PadMonitor.__init__):
	Publicize monitor.name.
	(PadMonitorSet): New object, factored out of FeedComponent.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py (FeedComponent.init):
	Make _pad_monitors a PadMonitorSet, which still derives from dict.
	(attachPadMonitor, removePadMonitor, setPadMonitorActive)
	(setPadMonitorInactive): Removed, now part of the PadMonitorSet.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_feeder.py (TestFeeder):
	* flumotion/test/test_component_padmonitor.py (TestPadMonitor):
	Split out tests from test_feedcomponent010.py, which wasn't even
	being disted, and which now is empty and deleted. Update to use
	new API.

	* flumotion/component/feeder.py (Feeder):
	* flumotion/component/eater.py (Eater): Move out to separate
	files.

	* flumotion/component/padmonitor.py (PadMonitor)
	(EaterPadMonitor): Move to a separate file; take the callbacks in
	__init__() so that we don't have to introduce a dependency on the
	naming of the component's interface.

	* flumotion/common/gstreamer.py (StateChangeMonitor): Move here
	from feedcomponent010.py; requires extra imports in this file, but

	from external modules.

	* flumotion/component/Makefile.am (component_PYTHON):

2007-09-12  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py (StateChangeMonitor):

	(FeedComponent): Refactor to use the StateChangeMonitor.

	* flumotion/common/gstreamer.py (get_state_change): New public
	function, moved here from feedcomponent010.py.

	rather than 'source'.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py
	(FeedComponent.install_eater_continuity_watch): New public method,
	watches some elements for discontinuity message; palliates some
	magical element naming intertwingliness.
	(FeedComponent.get_eater_name_for_feed_id): Remove; although
	switch needs it, switch should be refactored to make more use of
	Eater objects.
	(FeedComponent.do_start): Rename from link() and incorporate
	do_start() from ParseLaunchComponent, allows implementation of
	pure FeedComponent classes. Fixes #646.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(ParseLaunchComponent.FDSRC_TMPL)
	(ParseLaunchComponent.DEPAY_TMPL)

2007-09-11  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/launch/main.py (ComponentWrapper.eatFromFD)
	(make_pipes, start_components.do_start): Changes to make
	flumotion-launch work, after the eaterAlias changes.

2007-09-11  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	Restructure the FeedComponent and ParseLaunchComponent base
	classes to name their eaters by eaterAlias and feeders by feedName
	instead of by remoteFeedId and feedId, respectively. See #694.
	Incompatibly breaks the manager<->component interface, because the
	manager needs to refer to eaters internally and over the wire by
	eaterAlias and not by the id of the feeder that they initially
	eat from.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentAvatar.attached):
	Revert #721; this function spewed warnings on manager restart, and
	will be obviated by virtual feed-related changes.
	(ComponentAvatar.getFeedersForEaters)
	(ComponentAvatar.getEatersForFeeders)
	(ComponentHeaven._connectEaters)
	(ComponentHeaven._connectFeeders): Refactor a bit, reflecting the
	fact that we can refer to individual eaters by eaterAlias.
	(ComponentHeaven._connectEaterUpstream): Pass the eaterAlias to
	the remote eatFrom call.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py (FeedComponentMedium): Some
	data structure keying updates. Don't connect to feed-ready, the
	manager doesn't do anything with it. (Dunno why.)
	(FeedComponentMedium.remote_eatFrom): Add the eaterAlias argument,
	an incompatible remote method signature change.
	(FeedComponentMedium._getAuthenticatorForEater): Change from
	_getAuthenticatorForFeeder, take an eaterAlias instead.
	(FeedComponentMedium.connectEater): Take an eaterAlias instead.
	(FeedComponentMedium.remote_feedTo): A minimal update attempt, but
	the code is bitrotten.
	(ParseLaunchComponent.add_default_eater_feeder)
	(ParseLaunchComponent.parse_tmpl)
	(ParseLaunchComponent.parse_pipeline):
	(MultiInputParseLaunchComponent.get_queue_string): Rewrite the
	template parsing code to be more simple, and to not encode remote
	feeder names into eater element names. See #694.

	* flumotion/component/base/eaters.glade:
	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py (FeedersAdminGtkNode)
	(EatersAdminGtkNode): Update for uistate changes; show feedId
	separately from the eaterName in the eaters page.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py (Feeder): Key by
	feederName instead of feedId; including the component name is
	redundant.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py (Eater): Key by
	eaterAlias instead of by the id of the feed that we initially eat
	from. Adds new uiState keys 'eaterName' and 'eaterAlias', and
	moves 'eaterId' to be named 'feedId' in the connections dict.
	(Eater.connected): Add argument feedId, to indicate which feed we
	are eating from.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py (FeedComponent.init):
	Remove 'eaterNames' and 'feederNames' from the jobstate, they were
	not used. Publicize self.eaters and self.feeders, which are keyed
	by eater alias and feeder name, respectively.
	(FeedComponent.do_setup): Simplify the parsing of the 'eater' and
	'feed' config keys.
	(FeedComponent.get_eater_names, FeedComponent.get_feeder_names)
	(FeedComponent.get_feed_names): Removed, along with the
	attributes. Use component.eaters and component.feeders directly.
	(FeedComponent.bus_message_received_cb): Deal with changes; nasty
	in all cases.
	(FeedComponent.isEaterActive): New function, for switch. Needs
	review; probably better to have an isActive() method on eaters
	directly.
	(FeedComponent.get_element): Warn if the element is not found.
	(FeedComponent.eatFromFD): Add argument, eaterAlias. An
	incompatible change. Pass it on to Eater.connected().

	* flumotion/component/converters/overlay/overlay.py
	(Overlay.get_pipeline_string): Simplify.

	* flumotion/component/combiners/switch/switch.py: Some changes to
	attempt to make things work, but switch in trunk wasn't working
	anyways. Fix later...

	* flumotion/component/feed.py (FeedMedium.__init__): Remove the
	legacy mode of operation where the FeedMedium would automatically
	call eatFromFD on the component. requestFeed is the replacement.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_feed.py
	(TestUpstreamFeedClient.testConnectAndFeedLegacy): Since we
	removed the legacy interface on FeedMedium we can remove this test
	as well.
	* flumotion/test/test_component_feed.py (TestUpstreamFeedClient):
	Update tests to cope with FeedMedium changes.

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py
	(FakeComponentMind.remote_eatFrom): New arg in the prototype.

	* flumotion/test/test_component.py (TestExpandElementName):
	Removed, as the complicated code that it tested is gone. Yay!
	(TestParser): Update the tests to reflect what the new code should
	do.

2007-09-05  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(FeedComponentMedium.remote_eatFrom): Remove a FIXME, we will drop
	the old connection when the new connection suceeds, not when we
	start connecting.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (upgradeAliases, UPGRADERS): Add an
	upgrader for eater alias changes.
	(buildEatersDict): Instead of returning the eater config property
	as a list of feedIds, have it be a list of feedId, eaterAlias
	tuples. The eaterAlias will be constant across the lifetime of the
	component, but in the future the manager will be able to switch
	the feedId that the component is eating from. See #694.

	* flumotion/test/test_config.py
	(TestFunctions.testBuildEatersDict): Add some checks for the
	aliasing behavior.

	* flumotion/common/config.py:

	for changes to config['eater'].

2007-09-05  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py
	(Vishnu._upgradeComponentConfig.upgradeFailedWarning):
	* flumotion/common/config.py (upgradeEaters, UPGRADERS): Move
	upgraders to config.py, where they're more appropriate. Manager
	CURRENT_VERSION automagically.
	(upgradeEaters): Fix bug caught by pychecker.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu._upgradeComponentConfig)
	(Vishnu._getComponentState): Factor out the config upgrading into
	a separate method.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (CURRENT_VERSION)
	(ConfigEntryComponent._buildConfig): Add a 'config-version'
	element to the config, to be incremented when the config needs
	upgrading.

2007-09-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/manhole.py (SSHPublicKeyChecker): Stub out if
	we have a twisted without ISSHPrivateKey.
	(SSHPublicKeyChecker): Try a different hack.

	* flumotion/manager/depgraph.py: Editorialize more.

	* flumotion/manager/depgraph.py: Add documentation for the
	depgraph, along with some editorials.

2007-09-03  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/boot.py:
	  Fail to start if python is 2.5 or newer, and Twisted is older than
	  2.5.0

2007-09-03  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/admin/command/commands.py (do_managerinvoke): New
	command, invokes an arbitrary remote method on the manager.

	* flumotion/common/manhole.py (openSSHManhole)
	(openAnonymousTelnetManhole): New optional argument, the port
	number to request.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/Makefile.am (component_PYTHON):
	* flumotion/component/plugs/plugs.xml: Add to bundles and dist.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/manhole.py: New file, implements a
	manager plug that starts a manhole, either on ssh or telnet, and
	which can be opened or closed over the admin interface.

	* conf/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* conf/managers/default/manhole.xml: Add example for manhole plug.

	* flumotion/common/Makefile.am (flumotion_PYTHON):
	* flumotion/common/manhole.py: Add manhole module. MUAHAHA

2007-08-29  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_component_feed.py (FeedTestCase.tearDown):
	Appeasement.

	* flumotion/test/common.py (TestCaseWithManager.tearDown): Flush
	errors, in an attempt to appease twisted < 2.5.

	* flumotion/test/test_pb.py
	(Test_FPBClientFactory.flushNotAuthenticatedError)
	(Test_FPBClientFactory.tearDown): Reinstate some of the error
	flushing in an attempt to appease the bots.

	* flumotion/worker/medium.py:
	(WorkerClientFactory.gotDeferredLogin): Fix some nasties.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	* flumotion/component/bouncers/bouncer.py:

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py:
	* flumotion/twisted/portal.py:
	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py:
	* flumotion/worker/medium.py: Change to return
	errors.NotAuthenticatedError from authentication
	procedures/bouncers instead of cred.error.UnauthorizedLogin. This
	lets the error be serialized across a PB connection instead of
	causing a printout and a need for hacks in the test suite.
	Fixes #44.

	* flumotion/twisted/checkers.py (FlexibleCredentialsChecker):
	Don't subclass from InMemoryUsernamePasswordDatabaseDontUse, just
	pull its code in. Allows us to control the type of the returned
	failure (so it can be a pb.Error subclass).

	* flumotion/twisted/credentials.py (IUsernamePassword)
	(IUsernameHashedPassword): Re-export these from
	twisted.cred.credentials.

	* flumotion/twisted/pb/portal.py
	(BouncerPortal.getKeycardClasses): Don't return a failure here, as
	we don't have a pointer to the transport (so that we can drop the
	connection).
	(BouncerPortal.login): If we error because we have no bouncer,
	drop the connection as well. Otherwise both sides will chill in
	this state with an open TCP connection, and no reconnect attempts.

	broken out of tokentest.py.

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/tokentest.xml: Note that the token

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.xml: Add
	BouncerPlug socket to httpstreamer.

	(HTTPAuthentication.keepAlive)
	(HTTPAuthentication.cleanupKeycard)
	(HTTPAuthentication.clientDone): Instead of being vmethods,
	standardize on what the component should provide for us. This
	doesn't work for keycards expired on httpfile, though.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:

	HTTPAuthentication not a mixin.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add to dist.

	* flumotion/test/bouncertest.py
	(TrivialBouncerTest.setKeycardExpireInterval): New vmethod, so
	that test cases can virtualize this hack.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_bouncers_component.py: New test
	for the generic bouncer.

2007-08-27  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/Makefile.am: Autotoolage.

	  Put the synchronising identity after the videorate/audiorate,
	  so that if there's a substantial gap in the video frames coming out
	  of the gnlcomposition, videorate can fill in frames so that we never

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/bouncer.py
	(BouncerMedium.remote_keepAlive, Bouncer.keepAlive): Instead of

	issuerName.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_bouncers_bouncer.py
	(TrivialBouncerTest.testKeepAlive): Adapt test to new keepAlive
	semantics.

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py (Authenticator.ttl): OK! Since, in
	challenge-response authentication we have to allocate a keycard id
	<-> challenge pair, and we use challenge-response authentication
	by default, default to 30 seconds of ttl, so that we keep the
	keycard long enough to recognize a valid response, but not too
	long so that we leak memory by default.

	* flumotion/worker/main.py (main): Remove unneccessary ttl=0 line.

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py (Authenticator.ttl): Default to 0. There
	is no reason for the bouncer to cache keycards in authentications
	made with an authenticator, only in authentications made at
	streamers.

	* flumotion/worker/main.py (main): Give the authenticator a TTL of
	0, so that the manager never stores the keycards. Should fix
	keycard leaks in reconnecting worker<->manager,
	component<->manager, and component<->feedserver connections.

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py (Authenticator.ttl): New attribute, None
	by default.
	(Authenticator.issue): If self.ttl is not None, attach it to the
	keycard.

	* flumotion/manager/base.py (ManagerAvatar.perspective_keepAlive):
	New remote call, allows something logged into the manager to keep
	any keycards that it has authenticated from being expired.

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/bouncer.py: More doc.
	(Bouncer.addKeycard): If the keycard has a ttl <= 0, don't bother
	adding it to our data structures.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_bouncers_bouncer.py
	(TrivialBouncerTest.testAutoExpire): New test.

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/bouncer.py
	(Bouncer._scheduleTimeout.timeout, Bouncer._unscheduleTimeout):
	Infrastructure to time out keycards automatically if the keycard
	has a "ttl" attribute. Need to add support for resetting keycards'
	TTL values.
	(Bouncer.expireKeycardId): Actually pop out the keycard here,
	instead of waiting for confirmation.
	(Bouncer.expireAllKeycards): With expireKeycardId popping the
	cards, we need to iterate over a copy.
	(TrivialBouncer.do_authenticate): Add the keycard to the bouncer
	set.

	calls.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* flumotion/test/test_component_bouncers_bouncer.py: New file,

	* flumotion/component/combiners/switch/switch.py

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  If a component with no manager-side state and no config logs in,
	  just immediately tell it to shut down and then disconnect it.
	  We can't possibly do anything useful with it other than this, and
	  the previous approach (creating a fake config) didn't handle it
	  right.
	  Fixes a private bug.

2007-06-26  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/job.py:
	  Back out most of r5207, which didn't work right (it left stale

	  components without temporarily making them sad.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  If a component without config logs into the manager, add
	  'clock-master' and 'plugs' into the synthesised config we give it.
	  Should prevent KeyError: 'plugs' if someone/something tries to start
	  it (though starting it will still fail), and the clock-master will
	  prevent an exception being thrown that stops logout from completing
	  cleanly (which means that stopping the component doesn't work).

	* flumotion/component/base/scheduler.py (Scheduler._eventStarted)
	(Scheduler._eventStopped): Call eventStarted and eventStopped with
	the whole event, not just the content. Fixes to match
	documentation and the code in the disker.

	* flumotion/test/test_component_base_scheduler.py
	(SchedulerTest.testSimple): Expect the events, not the content in
	the event callbacks.

	* configure.ac: Only check for codegen things if we have the other
	dependencies to build the trayicon (GTK and python.h). Now there
	are no mandatory GTK+ checks, note that the pygtk one checks for
	pygtk.py, a part of pygobject. Fixes #224.

2007-06-12  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/admin_gtk.py:

	spinbutton sensitivity, and only save limits if the checkbuttons
	were on.

	* data/glade/wizard_http.glade: Add checkbuttons beside user-limit
	and bandwidth-limit. Bandwidth limiting defaults to off. Default
	to a user limit of 500 to avoid rlimit issues.

2007-06-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/webcam/webcam.py
	(Webcam.get_pipeline_string): Support v4l or v4l2, depending on
	element-factory. v4l2 currently does not work because the driver
	needs to copy its buffers instead of having a limited set of mmap
	buffers.

	* flumotion/worker/checks/video.py (checkWebcam.tryV4L2): Add
	check for V4L2, only passes currently if you have CVS -good.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py
	(Disker.eventStarted, Disker.change_filename): When rotating from
	ical, take the rotate time from the ical event. Incidentally this

	either local or UTC. Update comment to document this. Untested!

2007-06-06  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/base/watcher.py:
	  Don't leak files that were seen changing but not stable, then

	Do not assume "default" as the eater name when building the

	* flumotion/component/base/scheduler.py (LocalTimezone): New
	class, based on documentation of datetime.tzinfo.
	(now): New function, like datetime.now() but returns a datetime

2007-05-30  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	  Two serious bugs fixed: connected-clients in the uiState should be
	  the number of clients currently connected, so don't try to put the
	  entire connected_clients list in there.
	  Don't use the wrong (non-existing) variable for the number of bytes
	  written for a running connection.

2007-05-30  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py:
	  Thanks to Andy for pointing out that I forgot to actually commit the

2007-05-29  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py:
	  This code only passes the testsuite because the testsuite runs with
	  a different reactor (selectreactor, rather than gtk2reactor).
	  Drop the connection in a more sensible way...
	  Prevents leaking all connections to the feed server (eek!)

2007-05-29  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	warn the admin if the configurations are different without
	modifying the manager's state.
	(Vishnu.emptyPlanet): Clean all messages from the planet.

2007-05-28  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Make link() return a deferred that fires when the pipeline goes
	  playing; removes special-casing in statechange message handlers.
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:
	  Now that link() returns a deferred, use that deferred.
	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:

2007-05-28  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/playlist/playlist.py:
	   GNonLin apparently likes leaving elements in PLAYING when you
	   remove them. Set them to NULL on removal. Hopefully this will fix
	   memory leaks.

2007-05-28  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py

	  Fixes #559.

2007-05-24  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:

	  There are some remaining.

2007-05-23  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Allow the component to respond to getState() remote calls before
	  login is complete, so that we can (in a later version) avoid some
	  races (e.g. #624) in connecting components. Unfortunately we can't
	  do that right now or a new manager will break existing components.

2007-05-23  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/launch/parse.py (Component.complete_and_verify):

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/Makefile.am.
	* flumotion/component/bouncers/ipbouncer.xml:
	* flumotion/component/bouncers/ipbouncer.py: Add a bouncer to
	authenticate based on remote IP address. Shouldn't currently be
	used because we currently take address to be whatever the remote
	side set it to be; need to sanitize in remote_login in pb.py.
	See #167.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (parsePropertyValue): Reintroduce
	some old Py2.3 compat code.

	switching really fast between eaters with audio and video.

2007-05-22  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_component.py:

2007-05-22  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/launch/parse.py: Refactor to use the new things in
	config.py. Code reduction. ALSO! THIS IS COMMIT 5000!!!!

	* flumotion/common/config.py (buildPlugsSet)
	(ConfigEntryPlug.__init__)
	(BaseConfigParser.parsePlugs.parsePlug): Change so that a parsed
	plug entry doesn't have the socket; it doesn't seem to be

	parse, with a hopefully helpful debug message.

	is being parsed.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (buildEatersDict)
	(parsePropertyValue, buildPropertyDict, buildPlugsSet): New
	exposed functions. Probably will be useful for -launch.
	(ConfigEntryComponent): Rewritten to do more: takes a parsed but
	potentially not valid input, validates it against the defs, and
	produces the canonical config dict.
	(ConfigEntryFlow.__init__): Add components list to constructor,
	and verify that it has unique component names.
	(BaseConfigParser): Rewrite so as to do no validation that would
	require the defs. Push component parsing down to here. Do all
	parsing via parseFromTable.

	(AdminConfigParser, ManagerConfigParser): Update for above
	changes.

	new functions we expose.

	  Use base directory to resolve relative paths.

2007-05-21  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/fxml.py (Parser.checkAttributes): Treat an
	empty attribute as missing; if you are going to specify foo="",
	you might as well leave it out.

	* flumotion/common/config.py
	(BaseConfigParser.parseVersionString): New util in the base class.
	(FlumotionConfigXML.__init__): Remove the call to parse() at
	__init__ time. No longer have a 'manager' attribute.

	"noRegistry" case.

	(FlumotionConfigXML._parseComponent): Use parseAttributes.
	(ManagerConfigParser._parseComponent): Actually parse the version

	Update to reflect semantic XML parsing at parse() time, not
	__init__() time.
	(TestConfig.testParseComponentNoWorker)
	(TestConfig.testParseComponentNoWorker): Update to expect
	different exception.

2007-05-21  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/playlist/playlist.py:
	  Add getCurrentPosition function.

	(ManagerConfigParser._parseManagerWithoutRegistry)
	(ManagerConfigParser._parseParameters): Split the code that parses
	manager parameters and the code that parses the bouncers and
	plugs; the latter requires the registry, which we can't use at
	first. Although they traverse the same data structure they do
	different things.
	(ManagerConfigParser.__init__): Add attributes: bouncer and plugs.
	self.manager is not used for bouncer and plug data.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py
	(Vishnu.loadManagerConfigurationXML)
	(Vishnu._loadManagerBouncer, Vishnu._loadManagerPlugs): New

	pychecker.

	This will allow simplification of the other parser.

	* flumotion/test/test_config.py: Fix some tests to test
	ManagerConfigParser instead of the flow parser.

	* flumotion/common/registry.py (RegistryParser.getComponent):
	Raise UnknownComponentError if the component type is unknown.

	* flumotion/component/producers/playlist/playlistparser.py:
	  Format exception messages properly when parsing fails.

2007-05-18  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/playlist/playlistparser.py:
	  Parse timestamps correctly in the format we defined.
	  Specifically: require and parse the fractional seconds part (it is
	  discarded, however; we only schedule on whole second boundaries),
	  and parse as UTC, not local time.

2007-05-17  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/playlist/playlistparser.py:
	  Throttle discoverer rate to avoid using too much cpu when adding a
	  long playlist.

	data there. Fixes #102.

	(HTTP.worker_changed.got_missing, HTTP.verify, HTTP.activated)
	(on_entry_mount_point_changed): There are two things that can
	prevent next from being pressed, lack of multifdsink and lack of a
	mount point. Make sure that both are necessary conditions for
	next. Fixes #68.

	* data/glade/Makefile.am (glade_DATA): Fix distcheck.

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py (Vorbis.get_state, Speex.get_state):

	mean 10 bits.

2007-05-16  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	  The wizard used (and still does, actually) set bandwidth-limit to
	  unreasonably low values, thinking it was in Mb/s (it's b/s).
	  If the bandwidth-limit is < 1000 bps, multiply by 1e6 to make it
	  sensible.

2007-05-16  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/enum.py:
	Modified the Enum jellying for the enum to be unjellyed

	  (HTTPFileStreamer.do_setup, HTTPFileStreamer.do_start):
	  We still need to distinguish between the root resource being the

	* flumotion/admin/multi.py (MultiAdminModel.__init__): Use a
	StartSet instead of our own ghetto homebrew.

	(TestFeedClient.tearDown): Use some terrible code that I found in
	test_pb.py to make trial not count UnauthorizedLogin errors as
	test errors, since we plan to make them. Trial gets these errors
	because Flumotion passes failures across the wire whose class is
	not derived from pb.Error, viz.
	twisted.cred.error.UnauthorizedLogin. We should pass
	pb.Error-derived errors, but my brain is too weak right now to
	handle all of the implications.
	(TestFeedClient.testBadPass): Enable test.

	* flumotion/test/test_pb.py: Remove
	ifWeHaveAnOldTwistedAndProgrammerNameEqualsZaheer invocations.

	* flumotion/common/debug.py (print_stack): New kwarg "file",
	defaulting to stdout.

	* flumotion/component/feed.py
	(FeedMedium._doFeedTo.mungeTransport._closeSocket): Fix too-clever
	code.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminClientFactory.gotDeferredLogin):
	Remove old challenge-response code; base classes do it for us now.

	* flumotion/twisted/portal.py (BouncerPortal.login): Return a
	failure if no bouncer is configured instead of None. Refactor
	slightly.

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py (FPBClientFactory._cbLoginCallback):
	Client-side remote_login() returns will never be None; remove this
	case.
	(_BouncerWrapper.remote_login): The one case in which None would
	be passed as return from BouncerPortal.login() was when no bouncer
	was configured; since that's fixed, no need to check for None
	here. Refactor slightly.

2007-04-26  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/test/test_http.py (FakeRequest.__init__):
	  Requests have args

2007-04-25  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	old workers can enjoy new feed code.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* flumotion/test/test_component_feed.py: Moved from
	test_worker_feed.py.

	* flumotion/worker/feed.py (FeedMedium.__init__): Make component
	an optional argument, only for back compatibility.
	(FeedMedium.requestFeed): New helper method, returns a deferred as
	the result of the whole operation: success with fds or error with
	a failure.
	(FeedMedium._doFeedTo): Adapt so that both the old eatFromFD and
	the new deferred interface are supported.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_feed.py
	(TestFeedServer.testConnectAndFeed.feedReady)
	(TestFeedServer.testConnectAndFeedLegacy.feedReady): I fixed the

	(TestFeedServer.testConnectAndFeed): New test for the new
	requestFeed interface.

	* flumotion/worker/feed.py (FeedMedium.startConnecting)
	(FeedMedium.stopConnecting): New helper functions. You can still

	thing, which is the case with older feedcomponent.py bundles.
	(FeedMedium._doFeedTo): AUGMENT THE TERROR! (It is commented.)

	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py (FeedAvatar._sendFeedReplyCb):
	Expand comment.

	an awesome mixin, like _SocketCloser, but sometimes not.
	(PassableServerConnection): Use the mixin.
	(PassableClientConnection, PassableClientConnector): New classes,
	the analogs of PassableServerConnection/Port for client-side
	connections.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_feed.py
	(TestFeedServer.testConnectAndFeedLegacy): Copy from
	testConnectAndFeed, a test that existing clients continue to work.
	(TestFeedServer.testConnectAndFeed): Use the new
	FeedMedium.startConnecting interface, which means we use a
	PassableClientConnector.

	* flumotion/worker/feed.py (FeedMedium._doFeedTo): Add a FIXME.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_feed.py
	(TestFeedServer.testConnectAndFeed): Clean up some prints, and add
	comments.

2007-04-25  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py:
	  Calling connectionLost() on a transport is fundamentally unsafe in
	  twisted.
	  Instead, we can make use of some undocumented behaviour to ensure
	  that the reactor will (safely) do it for us.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_feed.py:
	  Unskip test, make it pass (but needs some work)

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/file.py (File, File.__init__,
	  File.render, File.terminateSimpleRequest, File.renderAuthenticated,
	  File.createSimilarFile):
	  Comment and document.
	  Remove bogus pychecker inhibition.
	  Privatize File._component.
	  Instead of commenting badly named variables, use self-documenting
	  names.
	  Be a bit more strict about range headers we accept.
	  Make the start/end logic shorter and easier to grok by adding
	  first/last variables and simplifying.
	* flumotion/test/test_misc_httpfile.py
	  (TestTextFile.testWrongEmptyBytesRange,

	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py (FeedServer.listen): Use a normal
	portal, now that we can, with the modifications below.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (ProxyBouncer): Move here from
	feedserver.ManagerProxyBouncer, and pass to the feedserver on
	creation. No need to qual() the classes, they are already qual()'d
	remotely.

	* flumotion/twisted/portal.py (BouncerPortal.getKeycardClasses):
	Add some API behavior: if the bouncer has a 'getKeycardClasses'
	attribute, call it instead of accessing the keycardClasses
	attribute.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_feed.py (countOpenFileDescriptors):
	Interesting function!
	(TestFeedServer.testConnectWithoutDroppingPB): Add test, asserting
	on the number of open file descriptors at opportune times.

2007-04-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/worker/main.py (main): More use of PBConnectionInfo.

	* flumotion/worker/feed.py: Remove server-related code; client
	code has to stay here, because components call it.

	* flumotion/worker/medium.py: Factored out of worker.py,
	dispatches all requests to the worker brain.

	* flumotion/worker/feedserver.py (FeedServer): Server code
	factored out of flumotion.worker.feed. Synthesized a server object
	to be the calling-point for feedserver-related operations.
	(FeedAvatar.__init__): Take the mind directly instead of in
	attached. Fixes #566. Use the fpb.Avatar infrastructure for
	callremote, which gives us free logging. Remove use of crack
	IFeedServerParent.

	* flumotion/worker/job.py: Consolidate classes such that the
	JobHeaven object acts as the one calling-point for job-related
	functions. Factor the deferredstart code out into a separate
	testable class. Attach mind to job components directly instead of
	via a callLater; see #566.
	(JobInfo): Renamed from "Kid".
	(JobHeaven.spawn): Renamed from Kindergarten.play.
	(JobHeaven.getJobInfo, JobHeaven.getJobInfos)
	(JobHeaven.getJobAvatarIds): Renamed from getKid*.
	(JobHeaven.jobStopped): New method combining lostAvatar and
	removeKidByPid.
	(JobHeaven.shutdown): I believe the previous
	shutdown-but-possibly-kill code was buggy, and that this code is
	not.
	(JobAvatar.__init__): Take a mind directly in the init function,
	instead of via attached/detached. Derive from fpb.Avatar.
	(JobAvatar.setMind): Code moved here from attached(), no longer a
	defgen.
	(JobAvatar._sendFileDescriptor): FD sending factored into method.
	(JobAvatar.receiveFeed): Port mind-possibly-logged-out fix here
	from sendFeed.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py: Eviscerate. Moved medium and
	jobheaven code out to separate files; all that is left is the
	WorkerBrain.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/preview/preview.py (Preview):
	Disable QOS in the preview component; it's still not very usable
	though.

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py (Avatar.setMind): Update docs to say
	that it's best to setMind directly, not from a callLater.

	* flumotion/test/realm.py: New file, some infrastructure for
	setting up a PB realm listening on a random available port.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_medium.py: Move medium/clientfactory
	tests here; use the testrealm infrastructure to actually connect
	to a TCP socket.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_worker.py: Remove removeKidByPid
	test, that code is no longer there. Add test for initing worker
	brain.

2007-04-24  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/producers/soundcard/soundcard.xml:
	Soundcard should have higher clock priority than firewire.
	This is due to soundcard not working at all when slaved
	to a different clock.
	Fixes #547

2007-04-23  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* data/glade/admin.glade:

	* data/glade/wizard_firewire.glade:
	Change frame name to something representing the frame so it can
	be used in the code.
	* flumotion/wizard/enums.py:
	Firewire audio now has a step (when not used in combination with
	firewire video).
	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py (Production.verify, (FireWire.run_checks,

	  FireWireAudio.run_checks, FireWireAudio.firewireCheckDone,
	  FireWireAudio.get_next, Webcam, Overlay.worker_changed_010,
	  Overlay.get_next):
	Fix logic in verify().
	Create new FirewireAudio wizard step for use when firewire audio
	is being used without firewire audio. Remove whitespace. This
	class shares no code with the Firewire class because this wizard
	code badly needs refactoring.
	Add more stupid hardcoding in Overlay's get_next(). Refer to
	refactoring comment above.
	Fixes #111

2007-04-23  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	Allow volume effect to be configured to not allow increasing volume
	> 1.0 and also to be configured to not allow setting the volume.
	Soundcard's volume setting will go to 1.0 only.
	Soundcard component without gst-python 0.10.7 or later cannot set the
	volume.
	Expose these configurations in uiState so admin UIs can adapt.
	Adapt gtk admin page to make sensitive the widgets concerned with
	setting volume/increasing volume as appropriate.

	volume effect. Use input track and set it to record.
	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py (Soundcard.soundcardCheckComplete,
	  Soundcard.get_state):
	Remove use of defer generator.  Actually pass the input track
	so it gets added to the config for the soundcard component.
	* flumotion/worker/checks/video.py (get_tracks):
	Make check do state change in a thread.

	* flumotion/extern/log/__init__.py:
	* flumotion/extern/log/log.py (registerCategory, scrubFilename,
	  errorObject, TwistedLogObserver, TwistedLogObserver.clearIgnores,
	  _getTheTwistedLogObserver, addLogHandler, init, reopenOutputFiles,
	  logTwisted, setDebug, setPackageScrubList, getExceptionMessage):
	  Extract a log.py that can be used by other projects and is
	  standalone.  To that end, have init() take the name of an
	  environment variable that controls the debug level, and add
	  setPackageScrubList method to define which packages to scrub.
	  Also, raise SystemExit instead of a flumotion error.  Let's hope
	  that doesn't have unwanted side effects.
	* flumotion/common/log.py (init):
	  Now a rather barren file with stubs and compatibility stuff.
	* flumotion/test/test_log.py (TestLog.testLimitedError):
	  Small fix.
	  Fixes #594 and #595.

	  either.

2007-04-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/admin/command/main.py (setup_reactor):
	* flumotion/admin/gtk/main.py (startAdminFromGreeter.got_state)

	to catch bugs), and take a PBConnectionInfo, including the
	authenticator.
	(AdminModel.shutdown): More robust implementation.
	(AdminModel.reconnect): Don't much with clientFactory, just call
	shutdown() and then connectToManager().
	(AdminModel.connectionInfoStr, AdminModel.managerInfoStr)

	Update for new bundleclient interface.

	* flumotion/common/bundleclient.py (BundleLoader.__init__): Take a

	  waiting for it to be happy.
	  Prevents stale moodPending entries from remaining forever.

2007-04-03  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/planet.py (AdminFlowState)
	(AdminAtmosphereState, AdminPlanetState): Extend invalidate() to
	recurse into kids before chaining up.

	* flumotion/test/test_common_planet.py (InvalidateTest): New test
	that invalidating a planet does a depth-first invalidate on its
	kids.

	* flumotion/test/test_flavors.py (TestState): Factor out a base
	test case class.

	* flumotion/twisted/flavors.py (StateRemoteCache.invalidate):
	_ensureListeners() before accessing _listeners(). I tried for
	about 20 minutes to make a test case for this but failed.

2007-04-03  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/defer.py:
	  Remove reflect.namedClass call inside try block, so that a failed
	  call will result in us constructing a readable/useful generic
	  Exception, rather than a useless, truncated, ImportError from deep
	  in the reflection code.

2007-04-03  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/defer.py:
	  With python 2.5, CopyableFailures have a type attribute that doesn't
	  have the form expected by our defer_generator.
	  Instead, use the parents attribute, which is guaranteed to work the
	  way we want it to.

	  Fixes conversion of remote failures to exceptions in defer_generator
	  under python 2.5.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  Revert patch from #596, as it's no longer needed.

	* flumotion/component/effects/volume/volume.py (Volume.setUIState):

2007-03-29  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/main.py:
	  Reorder callbacks/errbacks in greeter to avoid double-destroying a
	  greeter and hence failing badly if we initially failed to connect to
	  a manager.

2007-03-28  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_common_netutils.py
	(TestRoutingTable.testParseFromFile): Add a couple tests.

	names optional. Trim trailing whitespace.

2007-03-27  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:

	  Fixes #596.

2007-03-26  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/service/service.py (Servicer._parseManagersWorkers,
	  Servicer.getWorkers):
	  Sort the list of managers and workers.

2007-03-26  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/feed.py:
	  Change indentation to 4 columns rather than 8 for one method.

2007-03-22  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/main.py:
	  Fix specifying admin on command line.

2007-03-22  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	  Don't use undefined variables if setup() raises.
	* flumotion/component/producers/looper/admin_gtk.py:
	  The admin told me this had a bug, so fix it.

2007-03-21  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/greeter.py (StartNew.on_next): Make sure
	that bindir is in the path when we run the service script.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/main.py: Make it so the greeter doesn't run
	a recursive main loop and just uses the reactor. Seems to work but
	will need some testing.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/wizard.py (WizardCancelled): New exception,
	errbacked by Wizard.run_async() if the user cancels the wizard.
	(Wizard.show, Wizard.destroy): Removed, GladeWindow does this for
	us.
	(Wizard.on_delete_event): Emit finished instead of stopping a main loop.
	(Wizard.run_async): New method. Returns a deferred that will fire
	when the user has decided on something.
	(Wizard.run): Implement using run_async.

2007-03-21  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/base.py (ManagerAvatar._mindCallRemoteErrback):
	  Use a better failure logging method.

2007-03-21  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	  (FeedComponentMedium.remote_setGstDebug):
	  add remote method that allows us to set a GST_DEBUG string at
	  runtime on a component.

2007-03-21  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py (FeedComponent.init):
	Check for existence of property rather than version.

2007-03-21  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.py:
	Someone forgot to add queues after the demuxer.  Not having queues
	breaks functionality with GStreamer >= 0.10.13.

2007-03-20  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  Because gstreamer now forks to regenerate the registry, this failure
	  mode results in the error propagating as a RuntimeError, not a
	  signal terminating our process. However, we must cope with it in the
	  same way, otherwise an early failure to start can cause us to end up
	  with an unstoppable component.
	  Fixes #592.

2007-03-19  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	Remove whitespace.  Thomas loves me.
	Firewire seems to give us offset disconts of -1 from time to time
	so > 0 should be changed to != 0 to decide whether to show
	offsets on UI.

2007-03-19  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  If we don't have a fully-logged-in component when it gets detached,
	  don't throw an exception, so that we can clean up fully.
	  Prevents a race condition from leaving a heaven with an entry for an
	  avatar that isn't present, thus stopping the component from ever
	  logging back in.

2007-03-15  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  If we fail to create an Avatar for a new connection, then drop the
	  connection after sending an appropriate failure to the client.
	  Fixes #588.

2007-03-16  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/message.py:
	* flumotion/common/messages.py:
	  Add a timestamp to messages so we can correlate them to other
	  events in the log.

2007-03-16  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	No data being received should be an info message.

2007-03-15  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/base/eaters.glade:
	  Only show disconts for timestamp/offset if there were any.

	* doc/random/synchronization:
	Add some blurb about timestamps, offsets and a couple of producers.

2007-03-15  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* doc/redhat/flumotion:
	  Pass status arguments through too.

2007-03-15  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/service/service.py:
	  A .pid file could be empty or contain garbage.  Clean it up in
	  that case.

2007-03-15  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* doc/random/synchronization:
	Update doc for renaming of components.
	Fix spelling mistake.

2007-03-15  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	Output a warning when we get an EOS message from something
	other than an eater.  Should only happen on producer components
	that only run for a finite time, such as dvb with a file.

2007-03-15  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* tests/integration/common.py:
	* tests/integration/test_qa.py:

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:

2007-03-15  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:
	  A lack of space after gdpdepay caused audio-encoder and video-overlay
	  to go hungry then lost (but sad internally).  Fix the space.

	* flumotion/component/base/Makefile.am:

2007-03-14  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:

2007-03-13  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	  Fix state watcher so setitem/delitem hides correctly.
	  Implement handling of offset disconts.
	* flumotion/component/base/eaters.glade:
	* flumotion/component/converters/overlay/overlay.py:
	  Overlay handles raw video and thus can check timestamps
	  and offsets.
	* flumotion/component/encoders/theora/theora.py:
	* flumotion/component/encoders/vorbis/vorbis010.py:
	  Encoders deal with raw data and thus can check offsets too.
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Set zero values on some keys.
	  Add Eater.offsetDiscont() and use it from imperfect-offset messages.
	* flumotion/component/muxers/ogg.py:
	  Ogg muxer should check incoming timestamps, but the offsets
	  are used to store granule pos, so ignore them.
	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py:
	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	  These consumers deal with muxed streams, so checking timestamps
	  does not work, but offsets should.

2007-03-13  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:
	  Add an identity checking for imperfect timestamps and offsets when
	  requested.

	  but simpler.
	* flumotion/component/encoders/theora/theora.py:
	* flumotion/component/encoders/vorbis/vorbis010.py:
	  For Theora and Vorbis it makes sense to check timestamps.

	  Add time/last/total/count Timestamp/Offset Discont to uiState's
	  connection.
	  Add last Connect/Disconnect, count/total Timestamp/Offset to
	  uiState.
	  Add Eater.connected/disconnected/timestampDiscont.
	  Add FeedComponent.checkTimestamp/Offset so that FeedComponent
	  subclasses can indicate whether it makes sense to check for
	  the specific type of discontinuities.
	  Check for imperfect-timestamp messages.

	  Handle the next button sensitivity while the wizard is doing stuff.

2007-03-12  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	  add a generic checkPlugin method to be used in checks

2007-03-08  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Checks are responsible for adding error messages to the component.
	  Fixes those pesky bogus component setup error messages without
	  info.

2007-03-08  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  Work around a pychecker bug so I can run pychecker again.

2007-03-08  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/fdserver.py:
	  Backwards compatibility for FDClient; accept messages without our
	  special magic cookie.

2007-03-08  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  WorkerBrain now only binds sockets in listen(), not in __init__,
	  which returns False if it fails.
	  Make sure various functions don't fail if we didn't call listen()

	* flumotion/worker/main.py:
	  Create WorkerBrain and call listen() on it before daemonizing.
	  If listen() fails, print an error and exit; this is fatal.

2007-03-07  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  After some timeout (this should be made configurable somehow), if
	  a job has refused to shut down, SIGKILL it.

2007-03-07  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py:
	  Rename file_fd to file; it's not an fd.
	  Where we claim to close the file, close it.
	  Don't call reactor methods from non-reactor threads; use
	  callFromThread.

2007-03-07  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	  Remove now-unused import to prevent complaints from pychecker.

2007-03-07  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	  client-added is called only from the reactor thread, so we don't
	  need a decoupling queue.

	  cliend-fd-removed is called by non-reactor threads, so handle this
	  with reactor.callFromThread() rather than reinventing that via a
	  periodic callLater checking a queue.

	  Everything that wants to update UIStates is now done in the reactor
	  thread, so just call update_ui_state, rather than setting a flag and
	  checking it periodically.

2007-03-07  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	  Don't update uiState objects from non-reactor threads.

2007-03-07  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Do not update UI state objects from non-reactor threads; doing so is
	  very unsafe.

	  Ensure we only operate on the FeedComponent._probe_ids dict with
	  'atomic' python operations.

	  Do not call any reactor methods other than reactor.callFromThread
	  from non-reactor threads. _checkEater calls many reactor threads and
	  also mutates other internal state; call this through
	  reactor.callFromThread too.

	  Eater reconnection should now be threadsafe.

	* flumotion/test/test_feedcomponent010.py:
	  Rearrange test now that some updating is only done from a
	  reactor.callFromThread call, so we can't check it immediately.

2007-03-06  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Move fd cleanup logic into the Feeder class.
	  Only close fds from the reactor thread; doing otherwise causes a
	  race.
	  Don't call get-stats unless we have plugins-base 0.10.11, because
	  an unavoidable race can cause segfaults in earlier versions.
	  Don't use the client-removed signal from multifdsink, since it's not
	  needed any more; we can't avoid the race we were trying to avoid.
	  Make getClients() return a list of FeederClients rather than a dict.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:
	  Don't attach client-removed signal.

	* flumotion/test/test_feedcomponent010.py:
	  Update for API changes.

2007-03-06  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:

	  Rename eaterConnected and eaterDisconnected to eaterSetActive,

	  Rename internal variables to match.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Use None for uiState values to indicate "component has no support

2007-03-05  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* conf/Makefile.am:

2007-03-05  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Don't traceback with older plugins base for the uiState

2007-03-05  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/common.py (daemonizeHelper._deletePidFile): Fix

	  connection problems.

2007-03-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Move fd out of the constructor for FeederClient, since it
	  is something that can change or be None during its lifetime.
	  Make sure we actually set .fd as well to be correct.
	  get-client-stats can return a 0-length array if the fd is invalid,
	  so warn better when that happens.

2007-03-02  Sebastien Merle  <sebastien@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	Added more comments and changed a class variable name
	to make it less ambiguous.

2007-03-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/test/test_feedcomponent010.py:

2007-03-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	* flumotion/component/base/feeders.glade:
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Make Feeder track FeederClient over multiple reconnects.
	  Add additional uiState keys, so we can get information
	  like total reconnects, total bytes read/buffers dropped,
	  and connect/disconnect times.
	* flumotion/test/test_feedcomponent010.py:
	  Add a unit test for the FeederClient behaviour.

	* flumotion/twisted/compat.py:
	* flumotion/twisted/gtk2reactor.py:
	* flumotion/twisted/Makefile.am:
	  We no longer support twisted 1.3, so we don't need a private copy of
	  the gtk2reactor. Also delete the code that picked which reactor to
	  install.

	* flumotion/common/boot.py:
	  Install a gtk2 reactor here unconditionally (moved from compat.py)

	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	  Add a utility function to set up our standard log messages and
	  optionally daemonize.
	  When daemonizing, a stale pid file is an error, always.

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Don't call self.error, as it tracebacks if we don't override it.
	  Don't override self.error to do silly things like stopping the
	  reactor unconditionally.

	* flumotion/job/job.py:
	  Do not call self.error

	* flumotion/manager/admin.py:
	  Don't raise SystemExit on a remote stop() call, just stop the
	  reactor.

	* flumotion/manager/main.py:
	  Use new startup helper for logging and daemonizing. Do not wrap
	  reactor.run in try/except. Do not print THOMAS WAS HERE, because
	  possibly thomas wasn't here.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  Don't call self.error, or override it, as above.
	  Add some API to Kindergarten to set a deferred to fire when our last
	  child terminates.
	  When shutting down, wait until children actually terminate.

	* flumotion/worker/main.py:
	  Use new startup helper for logging and daemonizing. Do not wait for
	  pids after the reactor exits.

2007-03-01  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/ui/glade.py:
	  Put back an experimental generator that was used by
	  flowtester.

2007-03-01  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/worker/main.py:
	  Factor out a method to read the config.

	* flumotion/job/main.py:
	* flumotion/manager/main.py:
	* flumotion/worker/main.py:
	  Make logging of start and stop of worker/manager uniform so
	  we can easily find those points in the log.

2007-02-28  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/defer.py:
	  Add a utility method to wrap a deferred with another deferred that
	  will fire in response to the first deferred firing, but only from a
	  callLater
	* flumotion/worker/main.py:
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  Remove old manual sigterm handling in favour of using a reactor
	  shutdown hook. Use new fdefer.defer_call_later to fire the returned
	  value from a callLater
	* flumotion/job/job.py:
	  Don't fire shutdown-hook deferreds other than in a callLater; needed
	  for PB correctness.

2007-02-28  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	* flumotion/twisted/fdserver.py:
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  Clean up more shutdown logic.
	  Ensure a failed login to the manager (other than initially) doesn't
	  cause a reactor shutdown.
	  Don't set our mood to sad when we just stopped the reactor; it isn't
	  useful.

2007-02-28  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	* flumotion/job/job.py:
	  Rewrite component/job shutdown to have a clean shutdown path going
	  only through the job.
	  Ensure through this path that we only ever stop the reactor once.
	  Should fix a variety of shutdown races triggered by calling
	  reactor.stop() from a reactor shutdown hook.

2007-02-28  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  client-removed has an extra argument; make sure we have it.

2007-02-27  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/fdserver.py:
	  Comments to make wingo weep a little less.

2007-02-27  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Split removeFDCallback into removeClientCallback and
	  removeFDCallback, attached to client-removed and client-fd-removed,
	  as required for race-free use of multifdsink.

2007-02-27  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/fdserver.py:
	  Stream sockets don't guarantee us message boundaries. We can't
	  switch to datagram sockets as they're unreliable. So, provide
	  protocol-level message boundaries for our FD-passing messsages, and
	  strip them out before passing on to PB.
	  Prevents protocol errors when connecting to the feed server under
	  load.

2007-02-27  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	  Ensure we chain up to our parent when stopping!

	  document that we're fine with the programs poking values into this
	  module
	  This allows a user to run an installed flumotion with the service
	  binary, without touching the system-installed directories.

2007-02-23  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	  Catch permission denied when not able to write to the log file.
	  Make sure we exit for that before we fork.

2007-02-22  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* bin/flumotion-tester.in (main): Fix bogus log statement, thanks
	to edrz for the tip.

2007-02-22  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	If we get a gstreamer error, errback any stateChangeDefers that
	are for state changes going up and any downward ones that start
	from a higher state than the current state of the pipeline.

2007-02-21  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/netutils.py (RoutingTable.fromFile): New way of
	instantiating a routing table, parsing from a file.

	* flumotion/test/test_common_netutils.py
	(TestRoutingTable.testParseFromFile): Test case.

2007-02-21  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  If we have previously successfully logged in to the manager, an
	  authentication failure should be non-fatal; it's probably a
	  transient fault.

2007-02-20  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/common.py (daemonizeHelper): Install a
	post-shutdown hook to delete the PID file.
	(daemonizeHelper): Fix the post-shutdown hook, and make it so that
	if we run and there's a stale PID file, we are more tenacious.

2007-02-19  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/encoders/theora/theora.py:
	Repeat after me, do not modify the config dict!
	Fixes #571

2007-02-19  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/launch/main.py:
	  print out additional debug info if it's there

2007-02-19  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py:
	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.xml:
	  make rotateType default to None
	  add an Error message if a rotateType is given but the
	  corresponding property is not

2007-02-18  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/icalbouncer.py:
	  a stray tab was breaking trial --coverage; expand it

2007-02-18  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* common/pychecker.mk:
	  Andy removed the configure-time GStreamer version checking,
	  so pychecker does not check 0.10 code anymore.
	  Since atm we always require 0.10, make this an always true statement
	  instead to get it checked.

2007-02-16  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/bouncer.py:
	  Refactor base bouncer class to split 'authenticate' into a base
	  method that enforces keycard classes and enabled/disabled state, and
	  a new 'do_authenticate' method for subclasses to implement their
	  specific behaviour, mirroring the setup/start/stop API.
	  Make base bouncer class have 'enabled' state, and remote method to
	  change it.
	  Add a trivial bouncer example that only acts on that state.
	  Add a subclass for challenge-response bouncers.

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/htpasswdcrypt.py:
	* flumotion/component/bouncers/saltsha256.py:
	  Move to using ChallengeResponseBouncer class.

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/tokentest.py:
	  Clean up now that new API does more for us.

2007-02-14  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/avltree.py (insert, delete): Fix string
	splicing.

2007-02-14  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	If we get a gstreamer error, errback any stateChangeDefers for
	READY->PAUSED.  This fixes issue where we do not errback on
	providing master clock.
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	Handle errback on providing master clock, and release port on
	error.
	Fixes #568.

2007-02-14  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/avltree.py (insert, delete): Fix string
	splicing.

	* flumotion/common/netutils.py (RoutingTable.addSubnet): Sanity
	check: net should not be too specific for mask.
	(RoutingTable.__iter__): Iterate the tree in reverse order, so we
	get most specific netmasks first.

	* flumotion/common/avltree.py (iteratereversed)
	(AVLTree.__iter__): Implement reverse iteration.

	* flumotion/test/test_common_netutils.py
	(TestRoutingTable.testBasicRouting): Rename from testRouting.
	(TestRoutingTable.testBasicRouting): New test, tests that more
	specific matching netmasks have precedence.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* flumotion/test/test_common_avltree.py: Add test for all kinds of
	insertion/deletion patterns. Hopefully comprehensive.

	* flumotion/common/avltree.py (height): Fix copynpasteo.
	(_balance): Fix balance factors and hdiff returns in a number of
	cases, brought out by the test suite.
	(insert): Only report an increase in height if the balance factor
	was even or tilted towards the inserted side.

2007-02-14  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.py:
	  always scale down to solve interlacing, even if the end height
	  is more than 288

2007-02-14  Sebastien Merle  <sebastien@fluendo.com>

	* common/pychecker.mk:
	Keep the environment PYTHONPATH variable.
	Now uninstalled gst-python can be used.
	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	Keep a reference to the glade file in BaseAdminGtkNode to be able
	to create more widgets from the same file.
	Added a method to create a new instance of a widget by name.

2007-02-13  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_common_netutils.py
	(TestRoutingTable.testRoute): Update tests.

	* flumotion/common/netutils.py (RoutingTable): Change "Network" to
	RoutingTable, and make it use an AVL tree.

	* flumotion/common/avltree.py: New file, an AVL tree
	implementation.

2007-02-13  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/icalbouncer.py:
	  Thomas broke ANOTHER THING WITH HIS DAMN RENAMING.

2007-02-12  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/netutils.py (ipv4IntToString): Change the
	algorithm to appease pychecker? Nits?

	* flumotion/common/netutils.py (Network._parseSubnet)
	(Network.addSubnet, Network.removeSubnet):
	* flumotion/test/test_common_netutils.py
	(TestNetwork.testAddRemove): Remove support for noncontinguous
	netmasks, as it seems they don't work on the Real Internet(tm).
	Fewer error paths!

	* flumotion/common/netutils.py (ipv4StringToInt, ipv4IntToString):
	New functions. We could use inet_pton and the like from socket,
	but the interface seems more error-prone.
	(Network): New object, a named set of subnets. Has a match()
	method to test if an ipv4 address falls within the set.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* flumotion/test/test_common_netutils.py: New tests, test ipv4
	parsing and the Network subnet set object.

2007-02-09  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* data/upgrade-to-0.4.1.xsl:
	  Rewrite theora bitrate rule to be more specific and elegent.
	  Fixes problem where all other bitrate props were being deleted.

2007-02-08  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common/common.mk (dist-hook): Add a dist hook to remove the
	cache dir, which could contain a registry after distcheck.

2007-02-07  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common/trial.mk (TRIAL_ENV): Make the environment that we run
	our tests in configurable, defaulting to top_srcdir.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am (TRIAL_ENV): Flumotion generates the
	env script, so set TRIAL_ENV to top_builddir.

	* common/trial.mk (trial): Use the env script instead of mucking
	with pythonpath. Other flumotion modules might need to add an en
	script.

	* env.in (src_dir): Properly subst in @top_srcdir@, which is
	relative to top_builddir.

2007-02-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/boot.py (init_gst, boot): Fix so that checking
	the version doesn't require a built installed/uninstalled.py.

	* configure.ac: When running python code from the source tree, add
	srcdir to the pythonpath. Fixes builddir != srcdir.

	* common/as-python.m4: Make it so that a negative result of a
	check is reported by python itself; allows multiple failure modes
	to be reported properly.

2007-02-06  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/common/boot.py:
	  Move tup2version() to where it needs to be to work.
	  Fix except call that pychecker didn't like.

2007-02-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common/as-python.m4: Allow stdout of the test program to hit the
	console. Write the catchall exception message to stderr.

	* flumotion/common/boot.py: Moved here from boot.py.in; not
	autogenerated any more. Less clever and more comprehensive checks.
	Don't munge sys.path any more to include dirs found at
	configure-time; instead if the caller wants to affect which pygtk
	we find it should change the environment. Fixes #500.

	* pkgconfig/flumotion.pc.in:
	* pkgconfig/flumotion-uninstalled.pc.in: Don't add gstreamer to
	the pkg-config requires; pkg-config is unsuited to flumotion.

	* configure.ac: Remove pkg-config checks for gstreamer and pygtk
	-- use the same runtime checks that flumotion uses. We have to
	check pygtk's pkg-config file tho, because of defs and codegen.

	* common/as-python.m4: Only check for python >= 2.2. Use
	sys.version_info instead of textual comparison. Add 2.3, 2.4, and
	2.5 as candidates.

2007-02-06  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* data/upgrade-to-0.4.1.xsl:
	  A more complete component name and property name upgrader. This one
	  works for all the configs I have.

=== release 0.4.1 ===

2007-02-01  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:

	  for that case.

2007-02-01  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Always exit after calling stop(), even if the component stop fails
	  for some reason (otherwise the component will be upstoppable).

2007-01-31  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* README:
	  We don't support twisted 1.3 in 0.4.x

2007-01-31  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/portal.py (BouncerPortal._authenticateCallback):
	* flumotion/worker/feed.py (getKeycardClassesCb): Debug
	improvements.
	(_WorkerFeedDispatcher.requestAvatar): Prevent a race condition if
	the remote side shuts down the socket right after authenticating.
	See #566.

	* tools/analyze-flu-log (TracebackAnalyzer.finish_traceback)
	(TracebackAnalyzer.print_summary): OK finally order them by when
	we first saw the tracebacks, and print a summary.

2007-01-31  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  A component config must ALWAYS have an avatarId, so when inventing a
	  config for a logging-back-in component, add this.

2007-01-31  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* tools/analyze-flu-log (TracebackAnalyzer): New log analyzer,
	finds unique tracebacks, printing them in order of how many times
	they were seen.
	(analyze, main): Add support for --tracebacks.
	(TracebackAnalyzer.linein): Break on 'Twisted traceback:' also.
	(TracebackAnalyzer.print_summary): Sort by count and length of
	traceback.

	* flumotion/test/test_twisted_compat.py: Remove tests for
	deprecated behavior, and enable tests that didn't work on T1.3.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py
	(FeedComponent.eatFromFD, FeedComponent.feedToFD): If we don't
	have a pipeline yet, just close the fd and return, assuming that
	the other element will eventually reconnect when we are fully set
	up.

2007-01-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/admin/commands.py
	(_parse_typed_args._do_parse_typed_args): Parse dicts and bools.
	For example, {(sb)(is)} foo true 3 bar => {'foo': True, 3=>'bar'}.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py (Window.setPlanetState): Accept
	the first flow instead of rejecting any flow not named 'default'.

2007-01-24  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  ignore already handled setup errors
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:
	  raise a handled error when we fail to parse a pipeline
	* flumotion/launch/main.py:
	  make sure we show messages
	  exit on handled setup errors

2007-01-23  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* doc/man/flumotion-worker.1:
	Fix man page, fixes #546.

2007-01-23  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* doc/redhat/flumotion: Lockfiles are only used if they have the
	same name as the init script, so set flumotion.lock iff a call to
	the init script succeeded and flumotion processes are running.
	(start, stop): Parse type and name more robustly, fixes names like
	foo@bar. Change so that a call to "flumotion stop worker foo"
	always tries to stop the worker; the logic of which workers to
	stop is now to check the PID files in $rundir.

2007-01-23  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/common/worker.py:
	Appease pychecker and make comment.

2007-01-23  Sebastien Merle  <sebastien@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	Trap ComponentSetupHandledError after component setup.
	Fixes #548
	* flumotion/common/worker.py:
	On special cases, the PID is None when processEnded is called,
	it failed trying to log it. Changed the ProcessProtocol
	to handle this case properly.

	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	  add docstring
	* flumotion/configure/configure.py:
	  privatize and remove type from variable name

2007-01-23  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/configure/configure.py:
	  Rename parseVersion and make it private to make sure no one uses
	  it outside of this module.
	  Don't call a tuple a Num.
	* flumotion/common/config.py:
	  replace with versionTuple
	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	  add versionTupleToString
	* flumotion/test/test_common.py:
	  and a test for it
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  Don't ever ever show a user a tuple! Also, provide a hint as to
	  what to do to fix the problem.

2007-01-22  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/log.py (reopenOutputFiles): Open both files in
	the same way -- since we don't go through the streams layer
	there's no need to think about buffering.
	(reopenOutputFiles): A final try to get the perms right, I seem to
	be stupid

	* doc/redhat/flumotion.logrotate: Add some more logrotate options.

	* flumotion/common/log.py (reopenOutputFiles): When rotating,
	create files with a 0640 mask.

	* flumotion.spec.in:
	* doc/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* doc/redhat/flumotion.logrotate: Install a logrotate file.

	format string in config.  Fixes #563.

2007-01-22  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion.spec.in: Make log, run, and cache dirs root:flumotion
	770 so that flumotion can rotate logs, manage its PID file, and
	also the registry cache.
	(user):

2007-01-21  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.do_check): Join strings, not ints. Thanks to
	Johan for the tip.

	  Clean up F0.2 TODO's.
	  Add _instanceSetup method so that we properly handle errors in
	  components in both cases.

2007-01-11  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/job/job.py (JobMedium.shutdownHandler): Wait for both
	calls to complete (either with success or failure), as they are
	independent, i.e. a failure on one does not mean the other will
	fail or fail to complete. Fixes components showing up as lost
	occasionally when a worker is control-C'd.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py
	(Vishnu._getComponentState.verifyExistingComponentState): If a
	component logs in with stale configuration, update our
	configuration instead of maintaining a difference between our
	config and what is actually running on the component. This kinda
	sucks, but fixes some cases between porters and streamers, whereby
	restarting a porter can cause the streamers to not be able to
	connect any more.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminClientFactory.gotDeferredLogin):
	Untested patch to respect tenacity if the login fails after the
	tcp connection is made.
	(AdminClientFactory.gotDeferredLogin): fix sin tax.

	* flumotion/admin/multi.py (MultiAdminModel.addManager): Take an
	optional tenacity argument, to pass on to AdminMode.connectToHost.

2007-01-10  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py (Avatar.disconnect): Return the result
	of loseConnection().

	* flumotion/common/server.py (Server.startTCP, Server.startSSL):
	Return the port we create.

2007-01-10  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/admin_gtk.py:
	Initialise _stats to None, so that a check on the value of _stats
	does not traceback if _stats is not set in time.
	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	Add a rotateLog method, mirroring the one in http-streamer.
	* flumotion/component/plugs/loggers.py:
	Add a rotate method, regression from 0.2.x.

2007-01-10  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.init): Create
	the jobstate with a mood of waking, because a component that is
	running is in at least the waking state by definition.
	(BaseComponentMedium.remote_getState): Remove mood check, as we
	initialize the mood correctly now.

	* flumotion/common/planet.py (ManagerComponentState.setJobState):
	Make sure mood is proxied last, fixes #552.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentAvatar._setMood): use
	setMood.
	(ComponentAvatar.detached): Actually unlink the jobstate and
	componentstate when the job logs out; was not being done before.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu._getComponentState):
	Because of the change in BaseComponentMedium.remote_getState, we
	know we will have a non-sleeping component mood, so we can remove
	this manual mood munge.
	(Vishnu.componentAddMessage)
	(Vishnu.workerAttached.workerAvatarComponentListReceived)
	(Vishnu._addComponent, Vishnu._updateStateFromConf): Use setMood.
	(Vishnu.componentStop.setSleeping): Set the component's mood to
	sleeping after the disconnect deferred fires, should be enough
	time for the component state to unlink from the job state.
	(Vishnu._createErrback): A failed component start because a job is
	already running only marks a component as lost if it did not log
	in in the meantime. Fixes #551. Also use setMood.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponentMedium.remote_getState): Make sure that the mood
	that we return is not sleeping. If it is sleeping, warn real loud
	and set the mood to waking.

	* flumotion/common/planet.py (ManagerComponentState.setMood): New
	method, sets the mood only if we are not listening to a jobState.
	The intention is that all sets of mood go through this function so
	as to prevent bad mood-proxy bugs like #551. The exception is that
	the manager is allowed to mark the mood as sad.

2007-01-03  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py: Import errors, thanks distributed
	pychecker

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py: Import common.
	(Avatar.mindCallRemote, Avatar.mindCallRemoteLogging.errback)
	(Avatar.mindCallRemoteLogging.callback)
	(Avatar.mindCallRemoteLogging): Floggulate.
	(Avatar.disconnect): Don't error if we're already disconnected.

	* flumotion/common/medium.py (PingingMedium._ping): PONG

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py (Avatar.__init__, Avatar.setMind): Add
	support in the base avatar for setting self.mind. This interface
	is orthogonal to that in flumotion.manager.base, because I don't
	want to change that implementation right now, and because there's
	no need for avatar.detached() given mind.notifyOnDisconnect().
	(Avatar.mindCallRemoteLogging, Avatar.mindCallRemote): Add support
	for mindCallRemote[Logging] in the base class, so that all avatars
	can easily support logging. Again this does not affect manager
	avatars because they override this implementation.
	(Avatar.disconnect): New method.

	* flumotion/common/medium.py (BaseMedium.callRemoteLogging): New
	method, contains the guts of callRemote, but with an extra param
	for the log level.
	(BaseMedium.callRemote): Call callRemoteLogging with level=DEBUG.
	(PingingMedium._ping): Use callRemoteLogging with level=LOG.
	(BaseMedium.callRemoteLogging): Add an arg for the stack depth,
	since this function can be called with different stacks.
	(BaseMedium.callRemote): Use stack depth.

	  clean up commenting in manager config

2006-12-19  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	  Log some additional porter-related information.

2006-12-18  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/common/planet.py:
	  Use 'append' on _jobStateListKeys, not 'set', so we don't clobber
	  messages added by the manager when the component logs in.

2006-12-18  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py:
	  Add 'messages' key to our ManagerJobState in FakeComponentMind;
	  tests pass again now.

2006-12-18  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/common/config.py:
	  Assume versionless components are the current version.

2006-12-18  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	of the same object are seen as the same by the jellier.
	Fixes #519.

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py
	(PlumbingAdminGtkNode.removeFeederClient): Fix a buglet with our
	use of the treemodel API.

2006-12-14  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  The call to setPlanetState on all views was wrong, and caused
	  tracebacks on reconnects due to the planet state being listened to
	  twice.
	  Removing it meant that the views were totally unused in all ways,
	  so deleted that code.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	* flumotion/admin/text/view.py:
	  Stop registering views, now that we no longer have that code.

	  authentication, so that the errors get set correctly.

2006-12-14  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_http.py
	(TestHTTPStreamingResource.testRenderHTTPAuthUnauthorized)

	(TestHTTPStreamingResource.deferAssertAuthorized): Fix bogus

	* flumotion/component/producers/audiotest/audiotest.glade.py:

	bad connection files gracefully. Fixes #471.

	* flumotion/test/test_dialogs.py (TestErrorDialog.testDialogRun):
	Deal with the errordialog returning a deferred. Unfortunately we
	still need the gtk main loop, for some reason.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py
	(Window.on_open_connection.refused): Catch all connection errors,
	not just ConnectionFailed. Fixes #298.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/main.py (_runInterface): Reworked to not run
	the error dialogs in recursive main loops, and to fix
	re-presentation of the greeter if the connection fails.
	Fixes #531.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/dialogs.py (ErrorDialog.run): Return a
	deferred instead of running a recursive main loop, prevents

	to return deferreds instead of running modally.

	(AdminClientFactory.clientConnectionFailed): Less reliance on

	Simplify by requiring callers to pass in event handlers for 'set',

2006-11-16  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py
	(AdminClientFactory.clientConnectionFailed): Treat ConnectErrors
	like ConnectionRefusedErrors, so that we can catch e.g. "no route
	to host".
	(AdminModel.connectionFailed): Handle all kinds of failures, not
	just two.

	* flumotion/admin/command/main.py (setup_reactor.failed): Print
	out unanticipated exceptions as well as connection failure/refusal
	messages.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminModel): New signal,
	'connection-error', for unanticipated errors when connecting.

	the model if there is an uncaught exception, rather than only
	logging the exception.
	(AdminModel.connectToHost): Connect to 'connection-error' so that
	we can errback on the connectToHost deferred.

	* data/glade/wizard_firewire.glade: Mark a couple of frames as

2006-11-15  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	Final fixor.

	* flumotion/common/common.py (daemonize): Just handle stdin here,
	stdout and stderr handled by log.outputToFiles.

2006-11-10  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	* flumotion/component/muxers/ogg.py:
	Redesign the way we build muxer pipelines, so we have a queue directly
	after the fdsrc, not after gdpdepay.

	Then, allow components to interceed in reconnection. Implement this
	for muxers, so they can unlock things stuck in queue.

	This prevents muxer deadlocks on reconnection attempts.


2006-11-09  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* tools/analyze-flu-log (HistogramAnalyzer): Fix to align buckets

	  Register the property with the correct bool type.

2006-10-30  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	When you stop a lost or sad component that has mood pending of
	happy, then reset moodPending to None.
	When a worker logs in, it should be told to start all components
	that are sleeping.  moodPending should not need to be checked because
	when a job is created, mood is set to waking.

	(ComponentRegistry.dump): Use the registry writer.
	(RegistrySubsetWriter): New class, writes out only the subset of
	the registry that is provided by the given bundles.

	* flumotion/common/bundle.py (MergedBundler): New object,
	extending the Bundler class to also package up bundles in addition
	to just files. The effect is that when you call bundle() on a
	MergedBundler, you get one zip with a union of all subbundles'
	contents, in addition to any loose files that you added.
	(makeBundleFromLoadedModules): New exciting function, outputs a
	zip file and a registry fragment corresponding to a subset of
	loaded modules. For example:
	FLU_ATEXIT='flumotion.common.bundle.makeBundleFromLoadedModules \
	/tmp/flumotion.zip /tmp/flumotion.xml flumotion' \
	bin/flumotion-launch videotest

	* flumotion/common/boot.py.in (boot): Support another environment
	variable, FLU_ATEXIT, that specifies a function to call just
	before exiting. Any arguments to the function should be given as
	space-delimited strings. For example, FLU_ATEXIT='a.b.c d e f'
	will evaluate a.b.c("d", "e", "f").

2006-10-26  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py:
	Use the summary of the event in the vCalendar as the filenameTemplate.

2006-10-26  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py:
	Add optional property to changeFilename where the filename template
	as a strftime formatted string can be passed.
	Example flumotion-command use:
	invoke /default/disk-audio changeFilename s abcd-%H%M%S

2006-10-26  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	  Roughly identical patch for httpfile component: adds

2006-10-26  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* conf/managers/default/flows/porter.xml:
	  Updated example.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py:

	  streamer connects to.

2006-10-25  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (JobHeaven.lostAvatar): Track when
	jobs go away, not just when they are added.
	(JobAvatar.perspective_cleanShutdown)
	(WorkerBrain.deferredShutdownRegistered)
	(WorkerBrain.deferredShutdownTrigger)
	(WorkerBrain.deferredShutdown): Add infrastructure to track
	whether a job is in the process of shutting down, so that if the
	manager finds out the job is gone before we do and subsequently
	asks for the component to start, that we accept that request, and
	handle it when we eventually reap the job.
	(WorkerBrain.deferredCreate): Refuse to start a job that we
	already have running, unless it is already in the process of
	shutting down.
	(JobProcessProtocol.processEnded): Tell the heaven to lose its
	avatar. Also tell the workerbrain that the job was reaped, if a
	deferred shutdown was registered.

	* flumotion/job/job.py (JobMedium.shutdownHandler): Normally if
	the worker is asked to start a component that it already has, it
	refuses. However when we're being shutdown there's an unavoidable
	race between the manager and worker finding out about the
	component logging out.

2006-10-25  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py:

	  further work, but this is ok for now.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py

	respectively.

2006-10-24  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py:
	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.xml:
	  Merge part of #486 (not all yet). Adds remote stopRecording method,
	  and start-recording property which can be used to disable the disker
	  starting writing when started.

2006-10-24  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Change variable name to be more similar to the other uses of the

2006-10-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py (ComponentAvatar.__init__):
	Update docs.
	(ComponentAvatar.attached): No need to get the jobstate,
	Vishnu.componentAttached does it for us now.
	(ComponentHeaven.registerComponent): Nothing to do anymore.

	* flumotion/manager/base.py (ManagerHeaven.createAvatar): More
	debugging.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu.componentAttached,
	(Vishnu.componentDetached, Vishnu._getComponentState): Rework what
	happens when a component is attached so that we always ask, first
	thing, what the component's config and jobstate are. This allows
	us to get a mood early, reduces the number of not-quite-set-up
	states, and allows us to see if a component is running with an old
	config or not.
	(Vishnu.registerComponent): Remove lots of code, now folded into
	_getComponentState.

	These changes help manager restart to work in more cases. Also,
	atmosphere components are now properly put into the atmosphere
	instead of a flow named atmosphere.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponentMedium.remote_getConfig): Less hysteric log.
	(BaseComponent.setup.setupErrback): More debugging.

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py
	(FakeComponentMind.remote_getConfig): Implement getConfig.
	(_logoutAvatar, TestVishnu._requestAvatar.got_result): A little
	more cleverness here.
	(MyListener.stateSet): Although deferred does indeed start with d,
	it is formatted using %s.

	* tools/analyze-flu-log (log_re): Fix PID parsing.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	Add event probe to each gdpdepay's src pad to filter subsequent

	Update test.xml for GStreamer 0.10.
	* flumotion/common/boot.py.in:

	it munges stuff.

2006-09-08  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* configure.ac:
	  Check for PyGTK didn't work since I upgraded to 2.10.x, since it was
	  a string comparison. Since we have a check for the appropriate
	  version already there, ~10 lines above, just delete that.

2006-09-08  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/test/integration/test_qa.py:

2006-09-07  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/parts.py (ComponentMenu.__init__): Remove

	(FlumotionConfigXML._parseManager): Make sure that <component>
	nodes have a worker attribute, except if we are parsing a bouncer
	component for a manager, in which case the worker attribute can't
	be present. (Got it?)

	* flumotion/test/test_config.py
	(TestConfig.testParseComponentNoWorker): Add a new test, ensuring
	that all component entries have non-null worker attributes. Adapt

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_depgraph.py:
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py:
	  Revert recent depgraph changes, so we again set up clock masters
	  before starting them.

	  Now, in provide_master_clock, set the pipeline to PAUSED before
	  trying to get the pipeline clock, to ensure we get the correct
	  clock. Add some generic infrastructure to wait for a particular
	  state change.

	  Fixes #447.

2006-09-05  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	ASF should not send a Pragma header with features=broadcast.

	component startup: components connect over pipes instead of TCP
	ports.

	* flumotion/launch/parse.py: New file, exports one function that
	takes an argv fragment and returns an ordered list of config
	dicts. Refactorage.

	* flumotion/test/test_dag.py (TestDAG.testSort): Fix broken test.

	* flumotion/common/dag.py (topological_sort): Fix return to follow

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	Add debug to see when master clock is set on a clock slave.
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	In start, if component is the master clock, do not tell
	component to provide master clock.  That is done by
	tryWhatCanBeStarted.
	* flumotion/manager/depgraph.py:
	Make CLOCKMASTER dep on COMPONENTSTART, the GStreamer clock only

	Setting state to PLAYING can take a lot longer than 12.5 seconds
	so run in a separate thread.  12.5 seconds is our ping timeout.
	This fixes the Webcam worker check for example.

2006-09-01  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  comment on the FIXME

2006-08-29  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  add an event probe for EOS and swallow it - reconnect will be
	  triggered due to buffer probe.
	  There may be a better way to deal with this though.

2006-08-29  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  further fix feed reconnection for stopped upstream components:
	  - handle fdsrc EOS in bus handler by reconnecting
	  - in _checkEater(), try to reconnect even if the lastTime was
	    set to 0
	  - in eaterDisconnected(), reset lastTime to 0 to make sure
	    our checkEater() doesn't spuriously mark the feed as connected
	    again just because we received data right before the disconnect

2006-08-29  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  implement feed reconnection for eaters:
	  - make checks for receiving data per-eater instead of global
	  - rename to _checkEater, and keep track of callLater state
	    so we can use this method both as a callLater and a normal method
	  - add overridable vmethods eaterDisconnected and eaterConnected,
	    which by default set to hungry if any eater is disconnected,
	    and happy otherwise.  Subclasses can override this behaviour here.
	  - _checkEater will also re-attempt connection if the previous
	    reconnection did not result in receiving new data in the eater
	  - add a _reconnectEater method that properly reconnects, and
	    tracks state of connection attempts
	  - fixed EatFromFD() to handle the case where fdsrc is already in
	    PAUSED/PLAYING; where it doesn't accept a change of fd, by
	    taking fdsrc out, changing state, adding, and reinserting

2006-08-29  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:

2006-08-29  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/misc/repeater/repeater.py
	(Repeater.get_pipeline_string): This component was 25% buggy. And
	the other 75% was boilerplate. Don't overload the logs with a
	verbose message for every buffer.

2006-08-29  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	No longer using this ugly hack in httpfile.
	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	Use twisted's preferred way of having a tree of resources instead
	of Thomas's ugly hack.

2006-08-29  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.py
	(Firewire.getVolume): Implement this, needed for the volume effect

	  to multifdsink

2006-08-28  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	Check for file existing could never be run, duh!

2006-08-28  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	Forgot an import.  Bad me.

2006-08-28  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	* flumotion/component/misc/httpfile/httpfile.py:
	Copy Thomas's hacked subclass of Resource to httpfile
	so we can also handle non root dir urls in httpfile.

2006-08-28  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/component.xml:
	Add misc/__init__.py to component-base bundle.

2006-08-28  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  make hungry-because-of-eos sticky

2006-08-22  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  a lost component should also be stoppable.  Not yet sure
	  what should happen if the manager thinks it is "stopped", and
	  then the lost component logs back in though.

2006-08-28  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  Fix wrong number of arguments in commatized log statement.
	  Also, INFO and above needs to be clear, human-readably, and
	  not overly verbose.

2006-08-28  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  remove ugly hack by just logging the avatarId, which is more
	  correct anyway.

2006-08-28  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Improve comment that was a bit confusing.

2006-08-28  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	  Don't treat maxclients == -1 as meaning no client is allowed; this
	  means there's no max set.
	  However... don't set maxclient to -1 by default; default to using
	  the system soft limit - reserve.

2006-08-28  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/common.py: Fix a screwup.

	* flumotion/twisted/integration.py (Plan._makeOutputDir): Ensure
	that the test directory exists before making subdirs in it. Should
	fix twisted 2.0.1 build failures, where trial logs into
	/tmp/tmpXXXXXX instead of ./_trial_temp.

2006-08-28  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	* flumotion/test/test_http.py:

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Set mood to 'waking' when setup() is called.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  Note a waking component (on login) as having already been set up,
	  but not started.
	  A 'hungry' component is setup and started.
	  Improve some log lines.

2006-08-26  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	Fix docstring.

2006-08-25  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	Remove call to tryWhatCanBeStarted when component attaches, because
	we moved it to a similar place in vishnu where the depgraph
	setting is happening.
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	When worker attaches, check what components worker has running
	so manager does not attempt to start them.  Also make worker
	create any components that are lost but assigned for that worker
	and are not components worker already has running.  Useful when
	machine worker is running on has an unclean shutdown/power outage.

	Move depgraph setting on component attach to after we are guaranteed
	we have received the job state and hence the mood any components
	have before this connection to manager.  Fixes a race.
	* flumotion/manager/worker.py:
	Add remote method so that manager can query worker for what
	components it has.  Useful when worker re-connects after network
	failure so manager does not try and setup/start the components.
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py:
	Add stub method for getting components worker has.
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	Add remote method so that manager can query worker for what
	components it has.  Useful when worker re-connects after
	network failure so manager does not try and setup/start the
	components.

2006-08-25  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	  Our streamer component never supported non-root URI's.
	  Add handling for it...
	* flumotion/test/test_http.py:
	  ... and a test.

2006-08-25  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  When a component attaches to the manager, if it already has a happy
	  mood, set the depgraph setup and start nodes to true.
	  Avoids trying to re-setup/restart components that are already
	  running.

2006-08-25  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* doc/random/component-dependencies/depgraph-scenario2.dia:
	Update to new depgraph semantics.

2006-08-25  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* doc/random/component-dependencies/depgraph-scenario1.dia:
	Add missing dep lines between COMPONENTSTART nodes.

2006-08-25  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  when handling direct dependencies that can be changed, handle
	  all of them, not just the first one.  This allows other
	  non-depending components to start even if the first one ran
	  into an error.

2006-08-24  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/log.py:
	  log the str() of an exception, more useful than just the first arg
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  pass on on already handled component start errors

2006-08-24  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/log.py:
	  do not log an empty Exception.args[0]
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  also add ConnectError (No route to host) as something to show an
	  error message for. Log the frame inside this file, so we do not
	  see a defgen frame.

2006-08-24  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/errors.py:
	  clarify args of ComponentError and BusyComponentError
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  a component turning happy should clear its moodPending
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  reset moodPending when logging out
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py:
	  add fake eatFrom/feedTo
	  verify moodPending
	  fix test

2006-08-24  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/log.py:
	  clean up warningFailure, documenting it, and adding a
	  swallow boolean, that controls whether we propagate the failure or
	  not
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  use swallow, so that our second errback can still function and
	  throw up a decent message when we can't start a component

2006-08-24  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/log.py:
	  add ellipsize function for long (+8 lines) strings
	* flumotion/common/medium.py:
	* flumotion/manager/admin.py:
	* flumotion/manager/base.py:
	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py:
	  use it.  This makes sure we don't see complete .pyc files in our logs
	* flumotion/test/test_bundle.py:
	  allow for logging

2006-08-24  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  actually set moodPending, to make sure we don't start a component
	  more than once.  This fits with all the code that checks moodPending.
	  Solves the problem of having components being started more than once
	  if we have multiple loadConfiguration calls in a row.

2006-08-24  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	Document _tryWhatCanBeStarted a bit more and give rationale
	for why it's doing what it's doing.
	* doc/random/component-dependencies/depgraph-scenario1.dia:
	Update diagram to be up to date with latest component dependencies
	things.

	  log.getFailureMessage() is slightly more useful

2006-08-24  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Add a hack to figure out the name of a component that hasn't been
	  set up (because it never logged in) when printing out a login
	  failure message.

2006-08-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Dispatcher.createAvatarFor):

	an immediate value.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/identity.py
	(ExampleIdentityProvider.computeIdentity): Change this protocol to

2006-08-23  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	Set mood of component to hungry instead of sad when receiving
	an EOS.  The EOS is caused when it disconnects from it's feeder.

2006-08-23  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/boot.py.in:
	  reinstall our packager's import hooks
	  after installing the reactor
	  also, allow specifying whether we want gst as part of the boot
	  process, so we can disable it for programs that don't need it
	* flumotion/common/package.py:
	  factor out a Packager.install() method so we can reinstall the
	  import hooks
	* flumotion/twisted/compat.py:

	* flumotion/job/job.py:
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	* flumotion/manager/worker.py:
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py

	(_http_session_completed_to_apache_log): Assume that 'username' is
	in the args, and comment on the role of ident.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py
	(HTTPStreamingResource.logWrite): Add 'username' to args, with the
	intention of filling it in properly later.

	* flumotion/twisted/integration.py (ProcessProtocol.processEnded):
	More debugging.
	(PlanExecutor._checkProcesses): Debugging, and make sure we don't
	callback a Failure -- that would put us down the errback side.

	behalf.

	Be P2.3-friendly.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py:

	for new kill semantics.

	* flumotion/twisted/integration.py (Plan.kill): Change to only
	kill one process, with an optional wait status. status=None, the
	default, means that the signal handler kills the program. status=0
	means that the app caught the signal and returned 0.

2006-08-16  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common/setup.m4: No ac_dest in autoconf 2.60; but we do have

	integration framework.

	* flumotion/twisted/integration.py: New file, implements a
	framework for spawning processes from within unit tests, so you

	* flumotion/twisted/Makefile.am (flumotion_PYTHON): Requisite

	to props['port'].

	* flumotion/component/misc/porter/porter.xml: New optional

	we listen on 80, because iptables redirects 80->8800.

2006-08-09  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Make the interval for checking for recent-buffers 2.5 times the
	  interval we use for getting the buffer.
	  Having them the same frequently causes components to spuriously go
	  hungry, then back to happy shortly after.

	PBConnectionInfo auth changes.

	* flumotion/admin/connections.py
	(get_recent_connections.parse_connection): Read into a

2006-07-12  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	Merge the feed-1 branch:
	* flumotion/common/interfaces.py:
	  add IFeedMedium and IFeedServerParent
	* flumotion/worker/feed.py:
	  - actually add all objects - FeedComponentAvatar,
	    FeedClient, ... and the feedServerFactory method
	  - implement perspective_receiveFeed and perspective_sendFeed
	  - implement FeedAvatar (FeedServer-side object) and FeedClient
	  - rename internal dispatcher class; the idea is that a manager
	    could use its dispatcher, with a FeedHeaven, to proxy feeds
	    between components
	  - make ProxyManagerBouncer get keycardClasses remotely
	    add perspectiveInterface
	* flumotion/worker/Makefile.am:
	  add feed.py
	* flumotion/test/test_worker_worker.py:
	  fix test by adding a port to FakeOptions

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  - use fdsrc and multifdsink for feeders and eaters
	    remove _setup_eaters() and _setup_feeders() - now handled
	    outside of component
	  - add FeedToFD() and EatFromFD(), which are the new
	    interface points for making a component connect
	    to the outside
	  - change link()
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py:
	  - change do_start() to remove eaters/feedersData
	  - change ClientFactory to new interface
	  - implement remote_feedTo and remote_eatFrom

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  - add remote_getFeedServerPort()
	  - give the medium all but the last feeder port, which we
	    use for the FeedServer
	  - listen with fdserver.FDPort for the job server, so
	    we can pass fd's
	  - add WorkerBrain's IFeedServerParent methods:
	    eatFromFD and feedToFD
	  - add JobAvatar.receiveFeed
	  - store feedserver's port object so we can shutdown properly
	  - document JobHeaven.avatars so we are free to use it as public
	    API
	* flumotion/job/job.py:
	  Use a JobClientBroker that can receive fd's
	  handle getting a receiveFeed and sendFeed message
	* flumotion/job/main.py:
	  connect our job client with fdserver.FDConnector so we
	  can receive fd's
	* flumotion/manager/worker.py:
	  privatize portSet
	  get the FeedServerPort and use it instead of previous
	  separate reservedPorts
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  - factor out a getWorker, add a method to get feedServerPort
	  - add a warning for when a worker is already logged out when
	    we're trying to shut down a component
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  - clean up naming confusion in FeederSet and related, it
	    deals with feedId (componentName:feedName) now
	  - Use eatFrom() or feedTo() before start() to link components
	  - break out eatFrom into its own method, since we
	    are going to use it for reconnecting as well,
	    besides using feedTo too
	  - move the connecting of a component's eater to before the start
	    method
	  - remove feedersData, it's irrelevant now that the
	    component itself doesn't do the listening anymore for its
	    feeders
	  - implement both upstream and downstream connection, both work
	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	  add methods to deal with feedId, fullFeedId, componentId
	* flumotion/common/keycards.py:
	  also log the requesterName in our __repr__
	* flumotion/common/planet.py:

	  fix test by adding method to FakeWorkerMind

	* doc/random/naming:

	  dumb.

2006-07-12  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py:
	  - add an Authenticator object that can issue keycards and respond
	    to challenges on keycards, given the secret data necessary
	  - use this authenticator as an argument to login and startLogin,
	    instead of the keycard directly.  Also always use self.medium
	    as the client, and self.perspectiveInterface as the interface
	    being requested
	  - add a remote_getKeycardInterfaces to announce which keycards the
	    manager supports
	  - add a RemoteAuthenticator adapter that can be used to adapt
	    the pb.RemoteReference for an Authenticator to the same
	    Authenticator "interface"
	* flumotion/twisted/portal.py:
	  add getKeycardInterfaces()
	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:

	* flumotion/test/test_pb.py:
	  Test the new FPB, which uses authenticator
	  Also add test for the saltsha256 bouncer

2006-07-12  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/common/medium.py:
	  Remove bogus method.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:
	  When cleaning out the planet, we can only send stop() to components
	  for which we have avatars - if it's lost or sad, we might not.

2006-07-12  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py:
	  Improve test so that we test both expected and unexpected logouts,
	  and ensure that the state is correct (sleeping for expected, lost
	  for unexpected) after this.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_worker.py:
	  Make FakeRef stub out a few other things.

2006-07-12  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py:
	  Move PingableAvatar here.

	* flumotion/common/medium.py:
	  Move PingingMedium here.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  Subclass from PingingMedium

	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  Add a rather ugly hack to note here when we've stopped the reactor,
	  so that we can avoid calling reactor.stop() twice (which fails
	  badly).

	  Make BaseComponentMedium subclass PingingMedium.

	  Remove heartbeats, as these are now done by the PingingMedium
	  automatically.

	* flumotion/job/job.py:
	  When shutting down (in a system event trigger), do a remote call to
	  the manager to tell it that we're doing a clean shutdown.

	  Ensure we don't stop the reactor twice.

	* flumotion/job/main.py:
	  Add the system event trigger

	* flumotion/manager/base.py:
	  Manager-side avatars are all PingableAvatars, now.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  Remove manager side of heartbeats, now done by lower-level classes.

	  When a component disconnects, if the shutdown was 'clean' (as
	  notified by the component telling us with a remote call before it
	  shuts down), set mood to sleeping. For any other shutdown, mood
	  becomes lost (in both cases, we never clear a 'sad' mood, though).

	  Ensures mood transitions in all cases end up, correctly, in
	  sleeping, lost, or sad (and importantly, we never go through
	  sleeping on the way to sad now!)

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  Use PingingMedium

	was completely bogus.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/plugs.xml:

	(RequestStringToAdminLogger): Removed, uses an old interface

	requiring the caller to provide its identity.

2006-07-07  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/manager/main.py (_initialLoadConfig):
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (RUNNING_LOCALLY)
	(Vishnu._makeBouncer, Vishnu._addManagerPlug)
	(Vishnu._addComponent, Vishnu.loadConfigurationXML):
	loadConfigurationXML can be called in two ways: from a remote
	admin client, and during manager startup to parse XML files given
	on the command line. In the latter case we don't want to go
	through the adminaction mechanism. Make it so that bypassing the
	adminaction checks must be explicitly requested.
	(Vishnu.computeIdentity): Fall back to creating a remote identity
	object.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/identity.py
	(ExampleIdentityProvider.computeIdentity): IdentityProviders have
	to return instances of RemoteIdentity now.
	(IdentityProvider.computeIdentity): Make sure this method is
	implemented.

	* flumotion/common/errors.py (InsufficientPrivilegesError): New
	error, indicates that the remote caller does not have the
	necessary privileges.

	* flumotion/common/Makefile.am (flumotion_PYTHON): Dist.

	* flumotion/common/identity.py: New file, implements a base class
	for remote identities.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/Makefile.am (component_PYTHON): Dist.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/plugs.xml:
	* flumotion/component/plugs/identity.py: A sample implementation
	of the IdentityProvider socket.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (FlumotionConfigXML._parseManager):
	Support the IdentityProvider socket.

	* conf/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* conf/managers/default/exampleidentityprovider.xml: Plug file to
	enable the exampleidentityprovider.

	* flumotion/manager/admin.py
	(AdminAvatar.perspective_loadConfiguration): Give our
	remoteIdentity so that loadConfiguration instrumentation works.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu._addManagerPlug): Split out
	from _addManagerPlugs, instrumented for adminAction.
	(Vishnu._makeBouncer): Instrument.
	(Vishnu._addComponent): Instrument.
	(Vishnu._updateStateFromConf): Pass along remoteIdentity to
	_addComponent.

	* flumotion/manager/admin.py
	(AdminAvatar.perspectiveMessageReceived): Pass our remoteIdentity,
	not the avatar.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/adminaction.py
	(AdminActionFileLogger.action): Take a remoteIdentity, not an
	avatar.

	* flumotion/manager/main.py (_initialLoadConfig): Use the new
	loadConfigurationXML.

	* flumotion/manager/base.py (ManagerAvatar.__init__)
	(ManagerHeaven.createAvatar): s/keycard/remoteIdentity/.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Dispatcher.createAvatarFor):
	Instead of annotating the keycard and passing it around
	everywhere, call a _createIdentity function to create a
	manager-side object to describe the remote host. This identity
	will be used for logging via the adminaction mechanism.
	(Dispatcher.requestAvatar): Pass the remote host in addition to
	the keycard to createAvatarFor.
	(Dispatcher.__init__): Take a computeIdentity parameter, a
	callable that will return an identity object.
	(Vishnu.computeIdentity): New method, first tries to see if a plug
	can give a suitable identity to the remote host, falling back on
	the string 'user@host'.
	(Vishnu.__init__): Give our computeIdentity to the dispatcher.
	(Vishnu.adminAction): Take a remoteIdentity instead of the avatar.
	(Vishnu._addManagerPlugs, Vishnu._updateStateFromConf)
	(Vishnu._startComponents, Vishnu._loadConfiguration)
	(Vishnu.loadConfigurationXML): Because we want to instrument
	loadConfiguration more finely, we need to pass around the
	remoteIdentity of the caller. Do so.

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py
	(TestVishnu.testConfigAfterWorker)
	(TestVishnu.testConfigBeforeWorker)
	(TestVishnu.testLoadConfiguration)
	(TestVishnu.testLoadConfiguration): loadConfigurationXML, not
	loadConfiguration.

	* flumotion/manager/admin.py
	(AdminAvatar.perspectiveMessageReceived): Use vishnu.adminaction.
	(AdminAvatar.perspective_loadConfiguration): loadConfigurationXML,
	not loadConfiguration.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu.adminAction): New method to
	encapsulate the adminaction plug mechanism.
	(Vishnu._loadConfiguration, Vishnu.loadConfigurationXML): Split
	loadConfiguration in two, one part that makes a config object, and
	one that processes it. The one public interface is now
	loadConfigurationXML. Reflowed all helper methods so that the
	order of operations is more clear. Hopefully there are no semantic
	changes here.

	* flumotion/common/fxml.py (Parser.getRoot): Fix our
	filename-vs-string mess by taking only file objects as sources of
	XML. As a nicety, minidom allows a filename or a file object as
	the argument to parse(), so allow that as well.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (BaseConfigParser.__init__)
	(BaseConfigParser.add, FlumotionConfigXML.__init__)
	(AdminConfigParser.__init__, AdminConfigParser.add)
	* flumotion/common/registry.py (RegistryParser.parseRegistryFile)
	(RegistryParser.parseRegistry, ComponentRegistry.addFile)
	(ComponentRegistry.addFromString)
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu.loadConfiguration):
	Update for fxml Parser cleanups.

	* flumotion/test/test_config.py (AdminConfig, ConfigXML): Update
	tests to use file api instead of string api.

	* flumotion/manager/admin.py
	(AdminAvatar.perspective_loadConfiguration): The cleanups mean
	that vishnu.loadConfiguration has to take a filename or a file
	object; use StringIO to make a file object.

2006-07-10  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py (Disker):

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py
	(BaseAdminGtkNode.haveWidgetTree): Does not return anything any

	* flumotion/component/producers/looper/looper.py
	* flumotion/component/producers/looper/admin_gtk.py (LooperNode)
	(FileInfo): Use base glade support, and use UIState.

	* flumotion/component/effects/volume/admin_gtk.py
	(VolumeAdminGtkNode.haveWidgetTree): Use base glade support.

	* flumotion/component/effects/colorbalance/admin_gtk.py
	(ColorbalanceAdminGtkNode.haveWidgetTree): Use the base glade
	support. Assume that the UI will be set up when setUIState is
	called.

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py (BaseAdminGtk.setUIState):
	Call node.gotUIState instead of setUIState.
	(BaseAdminGtkNode.gotUIState): New method, here to ensure that
	setUIState is called only after the ui is properly set up.
	(BaseAdminGtkNode.render): If we already got the UI state, call
	setUIState. This means that all admin_gtk code should chain up to
	render() at some point, if they provide a custom renderer.

	* flumotion/component/producers/videotest/videotest.py
	(VideoTest):
	* flumotion/component/producers/videotest/admin_gtk.py
	(PatternNode): Update for uiState.

	* flumotion/component/effects/volume/volume.py (Volume): Update

	* flumotion/component/effects/colorbalance/colorbalance.py
	(Colorbalance.setUIState): Add keys to the UI state here.
	(Colorbalance.effect_setColorBalanceProperty): Don't do
	callRemote, refactor to use the uistate instead. Also, interpret a
	value of None to mean 'refresh the UI state'.
	(effect_getColorBalanceProperties): Gone, we have the UI state
	now.
	(Colorbalance._setInitialColorBalance): Small refactoring.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py (Effect.setUIState): New
	method, called by setComponent. The intention is to allow
	subclasses to add keys to the ui state in this method.

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py (BaseAdminGtk.setUIState):
	Actually implement, and use it to add a listener on the state.
	Chain up if you extend.
	(BaseAdminGtkNode.stateRemove, BaseAdminGtkNode.stateAppend)
	(BaseAdminGtkNode.stateSet, BaseAdminGtkNode.setUIState): New
	methods. The node will now get the UI state and listen to it
	automatically, users just have to override the statelistener
	methods.

	* flumotion/component/effects/colorbalance/admin_gtk.py
	(ColorbalanceAdminGtkNode): Refactor to use the uistate to
	communicate instead of remote calls. Also cleaned up a bit.

2006-07-10  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.xml: Remote

	the porter props.
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.configure_pipeline): Always get porter props
	when in slave mode.
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.do_start): No more autoconfiguration in
	porter slave mode. Removes the only call to componentCallRemote in
	the components.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentAvatar.perspective_componentCallRemote): Removed. It's
	too broad and has bad security implications. adminCallRemote is
	next :)

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/parts.py:

2006-07-05  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py:
	  Assert that the pipeline is None before setting it.
	  This triggers when restarting a manager; without the assert we end
	  up crashing in multifdsink.
	  Need to figure out why we're setting a replacement pipeline, but

2006-05-08  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:

	Merge trunk to porter branch (3041:3199)

2006-05-04  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/porter/porter.py:
	  Fix references to now-private variables.
	  Add exception handling around os.unlink().
	  Add some debug messages.

	* flumotion/component/porter/porterclient.py:
	  Use fpb.ReconnectingPBClientFactory instead of pb.PBClientFactory,
	  so we can reconnect automatically if our porter vanishes.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	  Adapt for automatic reconnection. Cleanup to not fire deferred
	  returned from do_start() until we've logged into porter and
	  registered ourselves successfully.

	  Automatic reconnection doesn't work without an explicitly-configured
	  porter socket path.


2006-05-04  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/pb.py:
	  Add a ReconnectingPBClientFactory that just adds reconnecting to the
	  pb.PBClientFactory (plus the gotLoginDeferred()/startLogin APIs),
	  so I don't have to deal with bouncers/keycards.

2006-05-04  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/twisted/fdserver.py:
	  Handle recvmesg() returning no message as CONNECTION_DONE, so that

	  twisted.

2006-05-03  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	  Comment out a wrong line in the test that was failing. Need some
	  explanation of the comment here?

2006-05-02  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/common/Makefile.am:
	* flumotion/common/netutils.py:
	  Nasty functions to guess a public IP/hostname when one hasn't been
	  explicitly configured.

2006-04-24  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/porter/porterclient.py:
	  Call startReading() earlier, now that I've convinced myself it's
	  safe to do so. Avoids nasty errors from abusing twisted's internals.

	* flumotion/twisted/fdserver.py:
	  Rewrite a bit so it's closer to what twisted does, and so that it
	  won't potentially drop FDs under heavy load.

2006-04-24  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py:
	  Clean up some of the comments here, which were out of date, wrong,
	  misleading, or all of the above.
	  Move a couple of lines into a different order along with a comment:
	  we don't ever want to use an FD as a key outside the lifetime of
	  that file descriptor.

2006-04-20  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:

2006-04-19  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/porter/porter.py:
	  Simplify porter Realm and Avatar some more.

2006-05-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/admin/multi.py
	(MultiAdminModel.addManager.disconnected_cb, close_admin):
	Refactor a bit so that close_admin is more of an action (by a user
	of the admin client) and disconnected_cb is a reaction to a
	disconnection. Calling close_admin will call shutdown on the
	admin, so that it doesn't try to reconnect.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (remote_shutdown): Remote method
	removed, nothing ever calls it AFAICT.
	(AdminModel.shutdown): New method, call it to shut down the
	current connection to the manager, and to not try to reconnect.

2006-05-03  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/plugs/adminaction.py
	(AdminActionFileLogger.action): I can't convince myself that
	keycards will always have usernames, so play it safe here.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu._addPlugs): We can have
	more than one plug of a given type, why not. Suggestion from
	Magnanimous Mike!

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu.loadConfiguration): Add a
	comment about the meaning of workerId == None.

	* flumotion/common/planet.py (ManagerFlowState.__init__): Comment
	the method's args.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (FlumotionConfigXML._parseManager):
	Make sure that the plugs dict has an entry for every socket, even
	if no <plugs> section is present.

2006-04-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/log.py
	(_handle, errorObject, warningObject, infoObject, debugObject)
	(logObject): Only splice if there are arguments to splice in.
	Should ensure that no existing case fails.

	* flumotion/common/log.py (errorObject, warningObject)
	(infoObject, debugObject, logObject): Interpret additional
	arguments after the first string as parameters to be spliced into
	the first as a format string.
	(error, warning, info, debug, log): Adapt to allow format strings.
	(Loggable.error, Loggable.warning, Loggable.info, Loggable.debug)
	(Loggable.log, Loggable.warningFailure, Loggable.logFunction):
	Adapt to allow format strings.

	* flumotion/test/test_log.py (LogFunctionTester.logFunction):
	Update so that the logFunction can take more arguments.
	(TestLog.testFormatStrings): Add new test for format strings +
	values in the logger.

2006-04-26  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/wizard/worker.py (WorkerListStore.__init__): Use the
	new set=None idiom from flavors to simplify our code.

	* flumotion/admin/multi.py (WatchedDict): New class, similar to
	the WatchedList. Note that this infrastructure was only being used
	by FGC, which hasn't been ported over from houston to multi yet.
	(MultiAdminModel.admins): Changed from a list to a hash table of
	managerId -> admin.
	(MultiAdminModel.addManager.connected_cb, close_admin): Adapt for
	changes.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminModel.__init__)
	(AdminModel.connectToHost, adminInfoStr): Create a managerId
	string for the manager, whose intent it is to uniquely identify
	the view that we have on the manager at the other end (read: the
	manager itself, plus the permissions we have for our user). This
	happened to be what adminInfoStr was before.

	* flumotion/twisted/flavors.py (StateRemoteCache.addListener):
	Make twice as useful to use and ten times more painful to
	implement by adding support for None values to mean that the call
	should be ignored. Useful suggestions for improving this
	implementation would be good.
	(StateRemoteCache.observe_set, StateRemoteCache.observe_append)
	(StateRemoteCache.observe_remove): Update to only call the
	set/append/remove if the function is there (non-false).

	* flumotion/test/test_flavors.py
	(TestFullListener.testStateAppendRemoveListener): Test positional
	arguments here as well as the keyword arguments above.

	* flumotion/test/test_common_planet.py (ListenerTest.setUp):
	Properly ignore those parts of IStateListener that we don't
	implement.

2006-04-25  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/wizard/worker.py (WorkerListStore.__init__): Hm, it
	seems we didn't actually implement IStateListener before.

	* flumotion/twisted/flavors.py (StateRemoteCache): Make the set of
	listeners a dict rather than a list.
	(StateRemoteCache.addListener): Add keyword arguments for the
	state set, append, and remove functions, so that listeners can
	specify which functions to use if they want. The functions are
	stored in the dict of listeners.
	(StateRemoteCache.observe_set, StateRemoteCache.observe_append)
	(StateRemoteCache.observe_remove): Update for the changes of the
	representation of the listener set.

	* flumotion/test/test_flavors.py (TestFullListener): Add test for
	the custom add/set/remove functions.

2006-04-25  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_flavors.py: Refactored so as not to use
	unittest.deferredResult, avoids lots of nasty warnings with
	twisted 2.2.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Vishnu.setConnectionInfo): Change
	using_ssl to use_ssl.

2006-04-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	using_ssl of the connection the manager runs on.
	(Vishnu.setConnectionInfo): A setter for connectionInfo.

	* flumotion/manager/main.py (_startTCP, _startSSL): Let the Vishnu
	instance know info about what connection it's serving on.

2006-04-20  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common/setup.m4: Convert to use the AC_CONFIG_* infrastructure,
	so that we can regenerate the output afterr a make clean. Involves
	some exciting eval hackery, but it seems to be par for the course.

2006-04-11  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/plugs/adminaction.py: New file. Defines a
	manager plug, AdminAction, that should get run when an admin
	performs a remote call on the manager. Defines two implementations
	of this plug, one that logs the call to a file, and another that
	logs it to a database.

	databaseadminlogger to registry.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/Makefile.am (component_PYTHON): Add

	when creating avatars.

	* flumotion/test/test_pb.py (FakeTRealm): Renamed from FakeRealm
	to indicate it presents a twisted-style interface.
	(FakeFRealm): New fake realm, deriving from FakeTRealm, but taking
	a keycard argument as well. For passing to
	flumotion.twisted.portal.*Portal.
	(FakePortalWrapperPlaintext.__init__)
	(FakePortalWrapperCrypt.__init__): Check the twisted-style realm.
	(Test_BouncerWrapper.setUp, Test_FPortalRoot.setUp)

	reflectcall.py.

	* flumotion/common/reflectcall.py: New file.

2006-04-20  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common/setup.m4: Convert to use the AC_CONFIG_* infrastructure,
	so that we can regenerate the output afterr a make clean. Involves
	some exciting eval hackery, but it seems to be par for the course.

2006-04-18  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/admin/Makefile.am (component_PYTHON): Add multi.py.

	* flumotion/admin/multi.py: New file, moved here from
	flumotion-ground-control (where it was known as houston). Its
	purpose is to be middleware(tm) between a client and many manager
	connections.

	* flumotion/test/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Dist the new test
	suite.

	* flumotion/test/test_admin_multi.py: New test suite.

2006-04-18  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  Fix bug #359: trigger deferredCreateFailed in ALL failure cases, not
	  just when catching ComponentCreateFailed

	* flumotion/job/job.py:
	  Add a hack to make it more likely that the worker will get a chance
	  to handle ComponentCreateFailed (and thus get a nicer error message
	  that we can show in the admin)

2006-04-18  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	  Add some basic useful local variables to the debug shell.

	  have been unused since 0.1.4

2006-04-14  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* common/pychecker.mk:
	  - use $(thisdir) correctly when we check for _build
	  - rename FLU_PATH to OUR_PATH, because these macros are shared
	    with other modules
	  - if GST_08_SUPPORTED and GST_010_SUPPORTED are not set from
	    configure, still work without errors
	  - x10 -> x010 for consistency

2006-04-13  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  create a Message when a job process dies with a signal, so

	  add perspective_componentAddMessage()
	* flumotion/manager/manager.py:

	  update protocol to reflect decisions about do_check
	* flumotion/common/errors.py:
	  add a ComponentSetupError
	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	  - make remote_setup() properly handle failures during component
	    setup, while still give the medium's setup the chance to failure.
	  - if do_check() generates an Error message on the state, turn sad
	    and don't proceed to do_setup()
	  - addMessage(): turn sad if an ERROR is added
	* flumotion/manager/component.py:
	  properly trap a ComponentSetupError seperately during setup
	* flumotion/component/producers/checks.py:
	  - share translations in messages, and make them uniform

	* flumotion/component/producers/looper/looper.xml:
	  - depend on producer-checks bundle, since it's being used

2006-04-10  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	(Parser.parseFromTable, Parser.checkAttributes): Doc.

	* flumotion/common/fxml.py (Parser.parseFromTable): Remove

	Actually do something with the disallowed argument.

	* flumotion/manager/base.py
	(ManagerAvatar.perspective_getBundleSums): Fix debugging if no

	(Soundcard.do_check): Update for check function name changes.

	* flumotion/component/producers/looper/looper.py: Rewrite to do
	the first segment seek from blocked pads instead of via an
	asynchronous message to the bus. Fixes some race conditions.
	Requires new GStreamer core and gst-python.

	* flumotion/component/producers/checks.py
	(checkTicket347, checkTicket348): Rename from checkPyGTK and
	checkPyGST, because they test for specific bugs. See #347 and
	#348.

2006-04-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponent.adminCallRemote): Add some docs. Ignore the call if

	* flumotion/manager/main.py:
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:

	(DatabaseLogger.translators): Make the 'database' plug property
	map to 'connection_name' for SQuaLe.

	* flumotion/extern/Makefile.am (flumotion_PYTHON): Add SQuaLe to
	the makefile.

	* flumotion/extern/SQuaLe.py: New file, implements a PEP-249
	interface for SQuaLe (squale.sourceforge.net).

2006-03-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.setup.setup_plugs)

	starting plugs.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/loggers.py (DatabaseLogger.stop): Make
	able to be called more than once.

	* flumotion/launch/main.py (start_components): Rework so as not to
	be a defer generator; defer generators are not appropriate if an
	exception can be thrown immediately.
	(main): Rework so as not to run the reactor if there is an error.
	(DeferredDelay): Pass through the value in the callback.
	(ComponentWrapper.stop): New method, stops the components if there
	is an error. Prevents a segfault when exiting due to a startup
	error.

2006-03-23  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	* flumotion/Makefile.am:

	* flumotion/porter/__init__.py:
	* flumotion/porter/porterclient.py:
	  Add porter client: all the code needed to attach to a porter server,

	* flumotion/extern/fdpass/__init__.py
	* flumotion/extern/fdpass/fdpass.c: (writefds):
	  Add package init.
	  Change return value from fdpass.writefds()

	* flumotion/test/common.py:
	  Hack from thomas to make distcheck pass due to fdpass being built
	  but the package init living elsewhere.

	* flumotion/twisted/Makefile.am:
	* flumotion/twisted/fdserver.py:
	  Add fdserver: twisted methods for connecting to unix FDs and
	  receiving appropriate fd-passing messages.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py:
	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.xml:
	  Add optional (untested, since we don't have a porter yet)
	  configuration to use the httpstreamer as a master (normal) or slave
	  (slaved to a porter). Defaults to master, which works as before.

	(TestConfig.testParsePlugs): Add a couple tests for the config
	parser wrt plugs.

	* flumotion/wizard/wizard.py (Wizard.on_realize): Get the style
	from the eventbox, not the window. Fixes two-tone wizard border in
	ubuntu dapper. Doesn't fix the orange color but that is an
	upstream bug. This one should probably be fixed in 0.2 as well.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponent.setup.setup_plugs.load_bundles): Only warn if we
	are actually going to be loading up plugs. This will still warn if
	bouncers have plugs -- will have to look at that later.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/loggers.py (DatabaseLogger): Add
	example schema.
	(DatabaseLogger.start): Change default table to be named "access".

	core does it for us.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/plugs.xml: Declare databaselogger and
	its properties.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/loggers.py (DatabaseLogger): New class
	to log directly to a database that supports the python database
	API version 2.0.

2006-03-22  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* configure.ac:
	  bump the minor version number, this is the crazy development
	  branch

	  build the Requires: line for the .pc file and use it
	* common/pychecker.mk:
	* flumotion/common/boot.py.in:
	  use _010, not _10, we don't want people to think GStreamer 1.0 is out

2006-03-22  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/launch/main.py: Refactor a bit to support adding plugs
	to components via "/plugtype,plugprop=val,otherprop=val". Also fix
	a couple of bugs caught by pychecker.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/loggers.py (ApacheLogger.start):
	Properly drill through the configuration structure.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(BaseComponent.setup.setup_plugs.load_bundles): Succeed even if we
	have no medium, albeit with a warning -- this is the case when
	using flumotion-launch, for example.

	* flumotion/launch/main.py (sort_components): Use
	dag.topological_sort.

	* flumotion/test/test_dag.py (TestDAG.testSort): Add test for
	topological_sort().

	* flumotion/common/dag.py (topological_sort): New function to
	provide functional interface to DAG code.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.start.start_plugs)
	(BaseComponent.stop.stop_plugs): Fix errors caught by pychecker.

	test_manager_manager test case.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (FlumotionConfigXML._parseComponent)
	(FlumotionConfigXML._parsePlug, FlumotionConfigXML._parsePlugs):
	Fixes for parsing <plugs> sections in config XML files.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.start)
	(BaseComponent.stop): Start and stop plugs as appropriate.

	* doc/random/component-initialization-protocol
	(BaseComponent.start): start() on a component should start()
	plugs.
	(BaseComponent.stop): stop() on a component should stop() plugs.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/plugs.xml: Add the adminlogger via the
	verbose "requeststringtoadminlogger" moniker.

2006-03-22  Zaheer Abbas Merali  <zaheerabbas at merali dot org>

	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.py:
	No point displaying firewire bus reset message

2006-03-21  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/plugs/loggers.py (ApacheLogger.start): Valid
	syntax, but still not implemented.

	* flumotion/common/registry.py (RegistryParser._parseEntries.addEntry)
	(RegistryParser._parsePlug): Raise the right error.

	* flumotion/test/test.xml:
	* flumotion/test/test_component.py:
	* flumotion/test/test_htpasswdcrypt.py:
	* flumotion/test/test_http.py:
	* flumotion/test/test_pb.py: No more logfile property in
	http-streamer, and the manual config dicts needed updating for
	'plugs'.

2006-03-21  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/extern/fdpass/Makefile.am (common_cflags): Compile
	with -fPIC. (How many more of this kind of commit will we have?)

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py (HTTPMedium):
	Remove code to do admin calls with logging information, that
	should be implemented via a logger.
	(HTTPMedium.remote_rotateLog): Call rotateLogs, not
	rotateLogfile.
	(MultifdSinkStreamer): No more log-message signal, or
	logfile-related code.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/resources.py
	(HTTPStreamingResource.__init__): Remove all logfile-specific
	code, just use the loggers set from the plugs.
	(HTTPStreamingResource.rotateLogs): Rename from rotateLogfiles,
	will call rotate() on all loggers.
	(HTTPStreamingResource.logWrite): Instead of generating a string,
	pass a dict with all necessary information to all loggers via
	event('http_session_completed').

	* flumotion/launch/main.py (ComponentWrapper.__init__): Set up
	config['plugs'] as the components expect it.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.setup): Setup
	the plugs before running do_check or do_setup.

	* doc/random/component-initialization-protocol
	(BaseComponent.setup): Update to note the need to do what is
	necessary to load up plugs.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (FlumotionConfigXML): Inherit from
	fxml.Parser so we get parseFromTable, and parseAttributes. However
	the parser isn't fully converted yet.
	(FlumotionConfigXML.__init__): Use fxml.Parser's getRoot.
	(FlumotionConfigXML._parseComponent): Call _parsePlugs to set
	config['plugs'].
	(FlumotionConfigXML._get_dict_value): Removed.

	New exciting parser that parses <plugs> sections from <component>
	blocks.

	that http-streamer supports the logger socket.

	* flumotion/component/plugs/loggers.py:
	* flumotion/component/plugs/__init__.py:
	* flumotion/component/plugs/plugs.xml:
	* flumotion/component/plugs/Makefile.am: New files,

	will.

	* configure.ac:
	* flumotion/component/Makefile.am: Update for new files.

	* flumotion/launch/inspect.py (main): Add support for showing
	plugs and sockets.

	* flumotion/common/registry.py (RegistryEntryComponent.__init__):
	Add an initarg for a component to declare what sockets it
	supports. Tell pychecker that's OK.
	(RegistryEntryComponent.getSockets): New accessor.
	(RegistryEntryPlug): New class, represents a <plug> entry in the
	registry.
	(RegistryEntrySocket): New class that is really just a string
	putting on airs.
	(RegistryParser.getPlugs, RegistryParser.getPlug)
	(RegistryParser._parseSocket, RegistryParser._parseSockets)
	(RegistryParser._parsePlugEntry, RegistryParser._parsePlug)
	(RegistryParser._parsePlugs): New parser accessors and parse
	routines, parsing standalone <plug> sections and <socket> sections
	within <component>s.
	(ComponentRegistry.getPlug, ComponentRegistry.hasPlug)
	(ComponentRegistry.getPlugs): New accessors for the registry.
	(ComponentRegistry.dump): Write out <plug> and <socket> sections

	* flumotion/test/test_registry.py: Update to look for some things
	in fxml instead of in registry.
	(TestRegistry.testParseComponents): Components don't have "name"
	attributes, and haven't for a long time. Fix XML, and remove tests
	relating to the time when they did.
	(TestRegistry.testParseComponentProperties): Fix XML.
	(TestRegistry.testParseComponentPropertiesErrors): Fix XML. Check
	the proper errors.
	(TestRegistry.testClean, TestRegistry.testComponentTypeError)
	(TestRegistry.testAddXmlParseError): Fix XML, check the right
	errors.

	* flumotion/common/registry.py (RegistryParser):
	Make the parser descend from fxml.Parser, and
	refactor most of the parser to use Parser.parseFromTable and
	parseAttributes. Result is that the registry is much more
	self-validating now, and the code is a bit cleaner.

	* flumotion/common/fxml.py: New file, pulled out of registry.py.
	Common routines for parsing XML files.

	* flumotion/common/Makefile.am (flumotion_PYTHON): Add fxml.py.

	* flumotion/manager/base.py
	(ManagerAvatar.perspective_getBundleSums): Change so that any of
	the arguments can be lists of strings in addition to simple
	strings. Allows the client to get the most bang out of the network
	buck. Also cleans up a bit.

	* flumotion/common/bundleclient.py (BundleLoader.getBundles): Note
	that the arguments can be scalar strings or lists of strings.

	* common/trial.mk (trial): Run trial without -R argument; seems to
	make twisted 2.2 happy.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.xml: Remove
	'gst-property' property from http-streamer; it's not implemented,
	and would cause a bug if you set it. Also it's the only property
	out there of type 'xml'.

	* flumotion/test/test_config.py (TestConfig.testParseProperties)
	(regchunk): No more tests for the XML type.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (FlumotionConfigXML._get_dict_value):
	Removed.
	(FlumotionConfigXML._parseProperties): No more 'xml' type.

	* flumotion/launch/main.py (topological_sort): New function,
	pulled in from Ofer Faigon via
	http://www.bitformation.com/art/python_toposort.html.
	(resolve_links): Don't print out links, we know that.
	(sort_components): Use topological_sort to sort the components so
	that we start them in order.
	(ComponentWrapper.__init__): Set config['clock-master'] as well.
	(ComponentWrapper.instantiate): Also setup() the component.
	(ComponentWrapper.provideMasterClock): New method, proxies to the
	component.
	(ComponentWrapper.start): Just start() here, setup() was done in
	instantiate().
	(DeferredDelay): New function, makes a deferred that will fire in
	the future.
	(start_components): Factored out of main() to be a
	defer_generator, because we have to deal with deferreds in the
	component protocol. Also takes care of setting up clocking in the
	pipelines. Starts components in order.

	* flumotion/worker/checks/video010.py (do_element_check): Doc.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.start): Assert
	that the do_start implementation returns a deferred, because we
	just pass along its return value.
	(BaseComponent._heartbeat): Make sure we don't get nastiness when
	calling heartbeat, but we're not connected.

	* flumotion/common/medium.py (BaseMedium.callRemote): Return a
	deferred in all cases. See #159.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.configure_pipeline): Refactoring to do most
	things in the configure_pipeline method. Still nasty though.
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.link_setup): No longer overridden.
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.do_start): Implement do_start instead of
	start(). This probably needs more support from the base classes.
	Pass along the superclass's do_start return value, or a defer.fail
	if the port was unavailable.

	* flumotion/common/config.py (FlumotionConfigXML._parseComponent):
	Wrote some notes -- maybe we shouldn't be passing so much to the
	component.
	(FlumotionConfigXML._parseSources): Doc.

2006-01-28  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/messages.py:
	  - remove the .install() function, better not to mess with __builtin__
	  - add N_ and ngettext functions, used for marking up strings
	  - add .gettexter(domain) and .ngettexter(domain) methods, which return
	    methods to create translatables as used by messages.
	    Typically used as T_(N_(format), args)
	    and TP_(ngettext(s, p, c), args)
	    These changes are needed because we were wrongly doing
	    N_(format, *args) which happened to work by accident but does
	    not conform to gettext markup
	  - make TranslatablePlural take a format triple instead
	  - make Translator do a 'C' translation if no other found
	  - make Message.add() check that it receives a Translatable
	  - add a Result class that can hold a list of messages, a failed
	    status and a resulting value.

	    everything needed to translate a message admin-side

	  2006 baby ! Brought to you by the Gratuitous Commit Department

2006-01-23  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* bin/flumotion-command.in (NEEDS_GTK): flumotion-command doesn't
	need gtk.

2006-01-17  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_wizard.py (WizardSaveTest): Apparently these
	skip attributes need to be strings.

	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py (TestVishnu): Make this
	first a log.loggable, then a unittest. Apparently unittest has
	picked up a .debug attribute which is a method that takes no
	arguments (other than self). Not sure what's going on here, but
	this fixes the test suite.

	* flumotion/test/test_common.py (TestObjRepr.testMe): Just test
	the repr of self -- works around what appears to be a bug in trial
	with twisted 2.1.

	* configure.ac: Check for twisted.web as well.

	* common/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* common/twisted-module.m4: New m4, looks for twisted pieces.

	* configure.ac: Check that the user has twisted.names installed.

	* flumotion/component/encoders/vorbis/vorbis08.py

	for props in the right place. Fix comments.

	* flumotion/component/converters/overlay/overlay.py (Overlay):
	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py
	(Disker): Add comments.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.init): Inits moved here from
	configure_pipeline().

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/bouncer.py (Bouncer.init):
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent08.py (FeedComponent.init):
	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py (FeedComponent.init):
	Changed from __init__().

	  now

2006-01-12  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent): Mix in the
	InitMixin, call it too.
	(BaseComponent.init): Init variables in init(), why not.

	* flumotion/common/common.py (call_each_method): Fix a bugaboo.

	* flumotion/test/test_common.py (TestInitMixin): Bling!

	* flumotion/common/common.py (_uniq, _call_each_method): New
	helpers.
	(call_each_method, call_each_method_reversed): New public
	functions to call a method for each implementation in a class
	hierarchy.
	(InitMixin): New mixin class that will call init() implementations
	on an object using call_each_method_reversed.

	Update for properties being in a subdict of config.

	* flumotion/test/test_component.py (PipelineTest): Adapt to new

	test, checks that chained errbacks work. Won't actually error if
	the traceback-printing bug is hit, but you will see output.

	* flumotion/twisted/defer.py
	(defer_generator.wrapper.with_saved_callbacks): New procedure,
	executes its arguments with the deferred's callbacks set to what
	they were in the beginning. A bit hacky but the rationale is in
	the comments.
	(defer_generator.wrapper.default_errback): Add errbacks from
	within with_saved_callbacks.

2005-11-09  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/worker/Makefile.am (flumotion_PYTHON): Remove job.py

	method, to be called before remote_start.

	* flumotion/job/Makefile.am:
	* flumotion/job/__init__.py:
	* flumotion/job/job.py:
	* flumotion/job/main.py: New files, yay. job.py is what
	flumotion.worker.job.py was. main.py is the code for the
	flumotion-job main loop.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerMedium.remote_start): Don't
	actually load the modules, just fetch the bundles and their paths.
	Fix already-starting error detection.
	(Kid.__init__): New field, bundles, the paths that the kid should
	register.
	(JobProcessProtocol): New class, lets the kindergarten know when a
	process exits.
	(Kindergarten.play): New option, bundles. Don't actually fork,
	just call reactor.spawnProcess on flumotion-job. Fixes lots of
	bugs.
	(getSocketPath): Moved here from flumotion.worker.job. Should be
	removed at some point, whereby workers communicate with jobs over
	normal fd's.
	(WorkerBrain.__init__): Don't set a sigchild handler, spawnProcess
	does everything for us.
	(WorkerBrain.keycard): New field; passed to jobs when
	bootstrapping.
	(JobAvatar.attached): Call 'bootstrap' on the job before calling
	'start'; allows the kid to register the necessary package paths,
	and to receive credentials for logging into the manager.
	(JobHeaven.getKeycard, JobHeaven.getWorkerName): Nice new methods,
	retrieve properties from the worker brain.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.xml: Add
	resources.py to the bundle.

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py (BaseAdminGtkNode.render):
	Catch errors loading the glade file.

	* flumotion/component/converters/overlay/overlay.xml: Bundle up
	genimg.py, the png files, and the font.

	* flumotion/common/bundleclient.py (BundleLoader.getBundles):
	Change to return a list of (bundleName, bundlePath) tuples instead
	of (bundleName, bundleSum).
	(BundleLoader.loadModule, BundleLoader.getBundleByName)
	(BundleLoader.getFile):
	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminModel.getEntry): Adapt to
	getBundles change.

	* flumotion/twisted/defer.py
	(defer_generator.wrapper.default_errback.print_traceback): Print
	out what is printing this message.

	* flumotion/test/test_worker_worker.py (TestKid.testGetPid)
	(TestKindergarten.testRemoveKidByPid): Adapt to worker.Kid()
	constructor change.

	* Makefile.am (PYCHECKER_WHITELIST): Add flumotion/job to the
	pychecker whitelist.

	* conf/workers/default.xml (feederports): Default to 20 free ports
	so that by default you can enable all 6 consumers.

	* bin/flumotion-job.in: New executable, run by the worker instead
	of having the worker fork.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES):
	* bin/Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): Add flumotion-job.

2005-11-08  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/worker/job.py (run): Run reactor recursively.
	(JobMedium.shutdown): Instead of cleanly exiting, do os._exit(0).
	Temporary hack, partially reverts changeset 2412.

2005-11-08  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent09.py:
	  log first buffer's timestamp on tcpclientsrc to help
	  in debugging startup time

2005-11-08  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	  Implement restart component

2005-11-08  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/debug.py (print_stack): New function, prints a
	backtrace with local variables.

	* flumotion/worker/job.py (JobClientFactory.login): Refactor a bit
	of the login code.

	(FeedComponent.link): No more notify-feed-ports.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(FeedComponentMedium.__init__.on_component_notify_feed_ports):
	Removed.
	(FeedComponentMedium.__init__): Don't connect to
	notify-feed-ports.
	(FeedComponentMedium.__init__.on_feed_ready): Pass the port we
	feed on, or None, instead of a boolean.
	(ParseLaunchComponent.do_start): Redoc.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentAvatar.perspective_notifyFeedPorts)
	(ComponentAvatar.perspective_feedReady): Combine two-stage
	"notify-feed-ports then feed-ready" into a one-stage "feed-ready
	with port" call. Removes some nice bugs. notifyFeedPorts is no
	longer there.
	(ComponentAvatar.perspective_log): Remove log method. used to be
	used for sending all logging events to the manager, but that was
	deemed too expensive months ago. A new logging framework would be
	different anyway.
	(ComponentAvatar.setFeederReadiness): Roll into
	perspective_feedReady.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py
	(Disker.link_setup.feeder_state_change_cb): Fix borken refactor.

2005-11-08  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/bundleclient.py:
	* flumotion/common/package.py:
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  Register package paths without rebuilding every possible module;
	  should both work and be fast enough

2005-11-07  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.py
	(MultifdSinkStreamer.pipe_template): Don't sync to timestamps in
	0.9.

	* flumotion/component/encoders/vorbis/vorbis08.py
	(Vorbis._start_feeders): Emit notify-feed-ports before going to
	playing -- prevents race conditions like the ones that were in
	feedcomponent08.py.

	* flumotion/manager/manager.py (Dispatcher.requestAvatar): Better
	debugging.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(ComponentClientFactory.gotDeferredLogin.alreadyLoggedInErrback):
	Punt on what the failure actually is...

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent08.py (FeedComponent.link): Set
	to paused, notify ports, then play. Fixes race condition between
	component and manager.

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py
	(Disker.pipe_template): Use a version-dependent pipeline.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent09.py
	(FeedComponent.bus_watch_func): Move hacky feeder->feed munge
	here...

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(FeedComponentMedium.__init__.on_feed_ready): ... from here. Fixes
	0.8 feed-ready notification.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent08.py
	(FeedComponent.feeder_state_change_cb): Remove out of date
	comment.

2005-11-07  Julien MOUTTE  <julien@moutte.net>

	* doc/man/flumotion-worker.1: Add example for feederports.

2005-11-07  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  remove loading bundles for component until we fix CPU use

2005-11-07  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py: Make it work
	with 0.9.

	* flumotion/common/boot.py.in (init_gst): Fix version check.
	(init_gst): Move the pygst_dir up to the front.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	(ComponentAvatar._mindGetStateCallback): debugging.
	(ComponentAvatar.perspective_notifyFeedPorts): Doc the argument
	type. Actually implement.
	(ComponentAvatar.start): Ignore the return value of calling start
	on the component, rather choosing to wait for the notifyfeedports.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(FeedComponentMedium.__init__.on_feed_ready)
	(FeedComponentMedium.__init__.on_component_notify_feed_ports):
	Hacks to make sure we callRemote with the right feeder names. The
	feeder names *really* need to be canonicalized at some point
	(feeder:foo:default vs foo:default vs default).
	(ParseLaunchComponent.do_start): Document obsolete return value.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(ComponentClientFactory.__init__): Clean some code that checks for
	obsolete conditions.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent09.py (FeedComponent.link):
	Pause the pipeline, notify the feed ports, and then set the
	pipeline to playing. Should avoid race conditions with the ports
	being ready.
	(FeedComponent.bus_watch_func): Fix some feeder name checks.

	* flumotion/common/gstreamer.py (verbose_deep_notify_cb): Don't do
	a g_idle_add so as to avoid bug #320886.

2005-11-03  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent): No more 'log'
	signal. Nothing was emitting it.
	(BaseComponentMedium.__init__): Don't try to connect to
	component's log signal.

	* flumotion/worker/job.py (JobMedium._enable_core_dumps): Fix some
	log typos.
	(JobMedium.threads_init): Removed, obsolete.
	(run): Reorganize try/except blocks.

	* flumotion/worker/job.py (run): Add some docs.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (JobAvatar.attached): Turned into a
	defer generator method. Folded in _cb_afterInitial; no need to
	call 'initial' on the job medium, as the options dict has all of
	the necessary information.

	* flumotion/worker/job.py (JobMedium.__init__): Set manager host,
	port, and transport directly from the options dictionary.
	(JobMedium.remote_initial): No need for this any more.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerBrain.deferredStartCreate):
	Throw ComponentAlreadyStartingError if appropriate instead of
	returning None.

	* flumotion/common/errors.py (ComponentAlreadyStartingError): New
	error, thrown when worker told to start a component but it's
	already starting.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerBrain._SIGTERMHandler): Don't
	set reactor.killed, the old sigterm handler will call
	reactor.stop() which will trigger .killed to be set.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerMedium.remote_start): Comment
	a bit.

	* flumotion/worker/main.py (main): Don't set reactor.killed,
	that's handled by flumotion.twisted.compat.install_reactor().

2005-11-03  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* conf/managers/default/flows/ogg-test-theora.xml:
	  update for component rename
	* flumotion/component/producers/audiotest/audiotest.py:
	* flumotion/component/producers/videotest/videotest.py:
	  for 0.8, make sure these GStreamer sources sync to the clock,
	  so they don't flood the CPU.

2005-11-02  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/common/log.py (scrubFilename): Whoops, pychecker
	caught a bug.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerMedium.remote_start): Turned
	into a defer generator method. Do a callLater right before forking
	so that the stack won't have any reads in progress -- because
	delayed calls are part of IReactorTime and read/writes are part of
	IReactorFDSet, they are guaranteed(tm) not to interact. Fixes lots
	of nastiness.

	* flumotion/common/debug.py (trace_start): Add ignore_files_re and
	write optional arguments.

	* flumotion/component/component.py
	(ComponentClientFactory.gotDeferredLogin.remoteDisconnected):
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py
	(WorkerClientFactory.gotDeferredLogin.remoteDisconnected): Know
	when to hold em, know when to fold em.

	* flumotion/twisted/compat.py (install_reactor): Add an instance
	variable, 'killed', that indicates whether a reactor is being
	killed or not. Allows reconnecting factories to know when not to
	warn.

	* flumotion/worker/job.py (run): Only profile if the FLU_PROFILE
	environment variable was set.

	* flumotion/common/log.py (_handle.getFileLine): Don't extract the
	whole stack, just work back frame by frame getting the information
	we need.

2005-11-02  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_log.py: Update test suite.

	* flumotion/common/Makefile.am (flumotion_PYTHON):
	* flumotion/common/debug.py: New module, exports trace_start() and
	trace_stop() procedures.

	* flumotion/common/log.py (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, LOG): New
	integer values exported by the module.
	(_levels, getLevel): Removed; levels are ints and not strings.
	(getLevelName): New proc. Does type-checking on its input. Should
	really have some nice decorators to check types.
	(registerCategory): Adapted for the change to levels.
	(_canShortcutLogging): New proc, returns True if no logging will
	be performed for this category at this level.
	(_handle): Make scrubFileName and getFileLine internal. Adapt to
	level changes. Don't call getFileLine if not necessary.
	(Loggable.error, Loggable.warning, Loggable.info, Loggable.debug)
	(Loggable.log): if _canShortcutLogging(), avoid doing expensive
	calculations.
	(FluLogObserver.emit): Adapt to level changes.
	(stderrHandler): Same.

2005-10-31  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(FeedComponentMedium.__init__.on_feed_ready): The remote method is
	feedReady, not notifyFeedPorts.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent09.py
	(FeedComponent.bus_watch_func): Set to happy only from the global
	pipeline state change message. Log a little less.

	* flumotion/worker/job.py (run): Profile the job if profiling is
	available. Don't start another reactor; rely on worker.py
	unwinding cleanly.
	(JobMedium.shutdown): Don't os._exit(0), allow twisted to clean
	itself properly.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerMedium.remote_start): Rework
	to receive return values both from the parent and child process.
	Now uses defer generators.
	(Kindergarten.play): Return the pid or None like os.fork().

	* flumotion/twisted/compat.py (install_reactor): Don't spawn
	threads to resolve names with twisted 2.0.

2005-10-27  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas (at) apestaart (dot) org>

	* flumotion/twisted/gtk2reactor.py:
	  replace _disconnectSelectable with code from 1.3

2005-10-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/launch/main.py (ComponentWrapper.__init__): Work with
	the 'source'-is-always-a-list change.

	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.py
	(createComponent): Throw a leaky queue after dv1394src, so that if
	the sink starts blocking the buffers still have somewhere to go.
	Otherwise the kernel starts complaining about every dropped iso
	packet, overloading the system.

	* flumotion/component/converters/overlay/overlay.py
	(Overlay.start): Don't rely on show_text or text being there.

	* flumotion/component/converters/overlay/overlay.xml: feed no
	longer a required property. width and height are, for now --
	although really we should just get this info from the incoming

	New function.

	* flumotion/component/encoders/theora/theora.xml: Add a component

	  so we can avoid having to import reactor this early

2005-09-08  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* bin/flumotion.in:
	* bin/flumotion-worker.in:
	* bin/flumotion-manager.in: Hard-code to use the 0.8 values
	detected in the configure script.

	* configure.ac: Check for both 0.8 and 0.9 versions of GStreamer
	and gst-python. Bling.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(FeedComponent::feed-ready): Changed from feed-state-changed, now
	just emits a boolean as to whether the feed is ready or not.
	(FeedComponent.feeder_state_change_cb): Emit feed-ready as
	appropriate. Don't set the component mood, it already did that
	itself.

	* flumotion/manager/component.py: Don't import gstreamer. Woot!
	(ComponentAvatar): Gone are _gstState, _gstOldState, dogs.
	(ComponentAvatar.setFeederReadiness): Renamed from
	checkFeederReadiness to ACT. Active functions. No more passivity.
	(ComponentAvatar.start.startCallback): Api update.
	(ComponentAvatar.perspective_feedReady): Changed from
	feedStateChange. Api update.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(ParseLaunchComponent.do_start): Changed from start, don't chain
	up.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.start): Made not
	a vmethod. Subclasses should override do_start.
	(BaseComponent.do_start): Default implementation.
	(BaseComponent.setMood): Fix typos.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponent.setMood): Don't
	let setMood work if we're in sad -- you have to restart to get out
	of sad.

	* tests/checks.py:
	* tests/debugslider.py: New files, ported over from the 0.9
	branch. Check the checker check check check. Is this thing on?

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py
	(FeedComponentMedium.remote_getState): Don't set
	state['elementNames'], it's not necessary.
	(FeedComponent.get_element_names): Removed, not used.
	(FeedComponentMedium.remote_play)
	(FeedComponentMedium.remote_pause): Removed, not used.

	* flumotion/component/producers/webcam/webcam.py
	(createComponent): Add a colorspace to make ppc happy for rgb
	formats.

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py: Callers of check_elements updated.

	* flumotion/wizard/wizard.py (Wizard.check_elements): Changed to
	just return a deferred with the missing elements, not to post
	errors.
	(Wizard.require_elements): This is what old callers of
	check_elements want to call.

	* flumotion/test/test_common_package.py (TestPackagePath.setUp):
	Initialize _assertions properly.

	* common/as-python.m4 (AS_PYTHON_IMPORT): Take an optional fourth
	argument, PREAMBLE, to do e.g. pygst.require(). Take an optional
	fifth argument, POSTAMBLE, to run code after the import.

2005-09-08  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Reorder options so as to give
	the user a nicer error.

	  arguments. Fixes some remaining parts of bug 273.

2005-09-06  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  When dumping a core, print out os.getcwd(), so we can tell users
	  where to find core dumps when they send us logs.

2005-08-29  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	  Look for LANGUAGE env var before checking LANG, makes translations
	  work on my ubuntu system.

2005-08-26  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/package.py:
	  reverse order of fixing up so we go from submodules to parent
	  packages

2005-08-26  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* common/epydoc.mk:
	  don't need PYGTK in there - it messes up our path and throws in
	  gst from installed packages

2005-08-17  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* common/trial.mk:
	  use PIPESTATUS so we can run, output to terminal, output to file,
	  and get exitstatus all at once ! I love the internet.

	* common/gendoc.py:

	  dist parts of the test dir so other projects can build on it

2005-08-03  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/converters/overlay/genimg.py:
	  Don't import PIL at top-level, instead defer this until we actually
	  run the generate_overlay() function. Avoids crash in theoraenc due
	  to clashing symbols, since with this we never dlopen() the clashing
	  libraries in the same process.

2005-08-01  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	  Use errors.NoBundleError rather than BundleError. This means we
	  catch the exception here, so it's non-fatal.

	  highest

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:
	  change getNodes to need to return a list instead of a dict
	  so the order is defined by the component, and not chance
	  add an on-the-fly conversion from dict to list so stuff
	  keeps working until things get fixed up

2005-07-30  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  use bundleclient instead of unbundler
	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	  add a debug to show that the admin really is handling NoBundleError
	* flumotion/common/bundleclient.py:
	  make getBundle also registerPackagePath
	  add getFile method
	* flumotion/component/base/admin_gtk.py:

	  before the widget tree is loaded; so save them temporarily

	* data/glade/authenticate.glade:
	  fix an assertion for grab_focus because the window was not
	  visible.  I'm pretty sure though that having grab_focus on the
	  auth combo box isn't actually useful; it's done when a) the widget
	  is not yet in a window and b) later on the focus is set to the

	  rework registry code so that
	  - internal API is marked as such
	  - for manager config files, initially only parts of the
	    .manager object are filled in that don't require the registry
	  This allows for registry parsing to be loggable and debuggable
	  since it now happens after setting the appropriate debug level.
	  I may be on crack.

	the proper range to avoid nasty messages.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/main.py (_runInterface): We're not yet in
	the reactor if the greeter is killed, so we can't stop it just

	Get ConnectionFailedError and ConnectionRefusedError from the
	right module.

	* flumotion/wizard/wizard.py (Wizard): No longer implements
	IStateListener -- WorkerListModel does this. Change to not rebuild
	the worker list all the time, instead just notifying when the page

	and go. Make an error message when no worker is available.

	* flumotion/wizard/worker.py (WorkerListStore): Take a
	WorkerHeavenState instead of a list of workers, and listen to it
	for changes. Add a ::changed signal for when workers are added or
	removed.

	listen to changes on the model to keep a worker always selected.

	(ComponentsView._add_columns.type_cpu_datafunc): Set cell renderer
	property values instead of model values. Prevents 100% CPU
	feedback.

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py (FireWire.run_checks): Display an info
	message while detecting the firewire device.

	  catch unwritable log file error
	* flumotion/worker/job.py:

	  make ERROR stand out some more

2005-06-11  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/component/bouncers/htpasswdcrypt.py:
	  raise ConfigError on IOError while reading htpasswd file

	* flumotion/manager/main.py:
	  move "import traceback" to top, so it doesn't mess up stack
	* flumotion/component/bouncers/htpasswdcrypt.py:
	  do a proper raise when a keyword is missing
	* flumotion/worker/job.py:
	  move "import traceback" to top, so it doesn't mess up stack
	  change source to moduleName since that's what it is
	  extract the exception traceback instead of the current stack
	  so we can log the cause of the problem

2005-06-11  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* doc/random/exceptions:
	  add some notes on exceptions and handling them
	* flumotion/common/log.py:
	  factor out a scrubFilename() function

2005-06-11  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/wizard/message.py:
	  use a longer name for cb
	  make them private attributes, because they are
	* flumotion/wizard/worker.py:
	  pychecker happiness

2005-06-11  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  another actual bug pychecker caught in three different ways.
		flumotion/admin/admin.py:162:
			Invalid arguments to (_makeFactory), got 2, expected 1
		flumotion/admin/admin.py:175:
			self is not first method argument
		flumotion/admin/admin.py:176:
			No global (self) found
	  I don't want to hear any more "useless pychecker" whining.
	  Solutions, not problems.

	* flumotion/wizard/worker.py:

2005-06-11  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/manager/main.py:
	  make sure we catch all raises from _initialLoadConfig correctly,
	  and print a traceback for those we don't explicitly handle

2005-06-10  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/wizard/message.py (MessageView.__init__): Back off on
	the padding of the message.

	* flumotion/wizard/worker.py: New file, implements a list of
	workers. Fires 'worker-selected' when the selected worker changes.

	* flumotion/wizard/message.py: New file, implements a message
	area, showing 0 to N messages. It hides itself when there are no
	messages to show. Messages have id's. They can be cleared by id,
	and no two messages of the same id will be visible at a time. The
	UI needs some work.

	* flumotion/wizard/wizard.py (Wizard.info_msg, Wizard.error_msg)
	(Wizard.clear_msg): New methods to show and clear messages in the
	message area. No more modal dialogs.

	and next button states right. Fire worker_changed on the step when
	we switch to it.

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py: All remote calls turned into
	defer_generator_methods for clearer code and default errbacks.
	Error and info dialogs turned into messages via info_msg() and

	(WizardStep.error_msg, WizardStep.clear_msg): New methods, proxy
	to the wizard.

	worker list.

	* bin/flumotion.in:
	  Remove unused PREFIX template var.  Fix the @libdir@ vs

	* flumotion/component/consumers/httpstreamer/http.xml:
	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py:
	  implement burst-on-connect.  Currently this is only sensible
	  for video, since audio frames are all keyframes, so it doesn't
	  give you a burst to sync to previous keyframe.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/parts.py:
	* flumotion/common/planet.py:
	* flumotion/component/component.py:
	* flumotion/test/test_manager_manager.py:
	  implement CPU usage monitoring.  Components will set CPU use
	  percentage since last heartbeat on the state, and the UI will
	  show it.  Needs factoring of the cpu code into an object
	  (when something else would start using it) and needs a celldata
	  func to be slightly nicer in the UI code.

	* flumotion/wizard/sidebar.py (WizardSidebar.pop): Return True if

	not the GTK one. Disconnect from the finished handler after one
	fire.

	raised by AdminModel.connectToHost's deferred.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminModel.connectToHost): Return a
	deferred instead of requiring callers to connect to the
	::connected and ::connection-refused signals.

	* flumotion/common/medium.py:
	* flumotion/manager/base.py:
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py:
	  make avatars (PB server) and mediums (PB client) figure out
	  addresses on both sides of their connection as seen by them.
	  Will be useful to figure out network topology and firewalls.

2005-05-23  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	* flumotion/service/service.py:

2005-05-20  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/common/log.py:

2005-05-18  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py: No more placeholders, no more

	* flumotion/wizard/step.py (WizardStep): s/step_name/name/. All
	accessors changed.

	Production button can have a Source title. Crack.
	(WizardSidebar.push, WizardSidebar.pop): Push and pop from the top
	of the stack, not the active section.

	* data/wizard/wizard_summary.glade: Fix visibility problem.

	tearing the stack logic out of the wizard.
	(BasicScenario): Basic scenario with six sections and steps

	* data/glade/wizard_overview.glade: Placeholder for forthcoming
	summary pages.

	* flumotion/wizard/types.py: New file.

	non-numeric keys as well. Perhaps a crack idea.

	utils out to the toplevel.
	(Vishnu._configToComponentState): New method, converts a config

	the avatar is unknown (i.e., if the manager quit and the component

	medium implementation in flumotion.medium.

	* flumotion/component/component.py (BaseComponentMedium):
	* flumotion/worker/worker.py (WorkerMedium):
	* flumotion/worker/job.py (JobMedium):
	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminModel): Descend from BaseMedium,
	removing unneeded code.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminClientFactory):
	AdminModel-specific client factory, encapsulating all of the login
	krap.
	(AdminModel::connection-refused): Don't pass connection parameters
	in the args, rather provide...
	(AdminModel.connectionInfoStr): New function, returns a
	human-presentable string for the connection parameters.
	(AdminModel.setRemoteReference): Extends the BaseMedium method,
	encapsulating all of the operations that happens when a model gets
	connected to a remote reference.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py
	(Window.admin_connection_refused_later)
	(Window.admin_connection_refused_cb): Adapt to connection-refused
	signal change, call connectionInfoStr().

	argument.

	(BaseComponent.__remote_interfaces__): Removed. What on earth was
	this, anyway? It's not referenced at all in flumotion or twisted.
	(ComponentClientFactory): Now a reconnecting factory. This means
	that if the manager goes away, components will try to reconnect to
	it later. Methods refactored to use the
	startLogin/gotDeferredLogin interface.
	(BaseComponentMedium.remote_getConfig): New remote method, will
	return the component's configuration dict.
	(BaseComponent.__init__): Chain up properly, add .dict instance
	var.

	on a component.

2005-04-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	  clarify other error condition

	  change UI a little to fit in panes and implement "distort" checkbox
	  use custom widget for level indicator with create function
	* flumotion/component/effects/volume/admin_gtk.py:
	  implement handling of the new ui
	* flumotion/component/effects/volume/volume.py:
	  use float multiplier values, not percentages
	* flumotion/component/producers/soundcard/admin_gtk.py:
	  make sure soundcard gets volumeSet for view node
	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.py:

	* flumotion/component/producers/soundcard/soundcard.py:

	* flumotion/test/test_common.py:
	* flumotion/common/common.py:
	  add pathToModuleName + test
	  document registerPackagePath
	  fix several subtle problems in registerPackagePath:
	  - warn on non-existing paths
	  - remove previously registered packagePaths for the same bundle
	    (which is a flumotion-specific hack, so needs fixing better)
	  - make sure the new packagePath is at the top everywhere,
	    because reload/rebuild.rebuild take the first valid one

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py:
	  check correctly for locally cached paths (bundle name was missing),
	  so it again only downloads missing bundles

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/client.py:
	  change show_component to not use a tempmod module, so rebuilding
	  works nicely everywhere
	  clear self.current_component so it can be used to check if
	  something's shown yet
	  check if it's set when doing outside ui change notifications

	* flumotion/component/effects/volume/admin_gtk.py:
	* flumotion/component/producers/soundcard/admin_gtk.py:
	  use as test bed for registerPackagePath fixing

2005-02-01  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/wizard/wizard.py: Fix the ugly colors of the sidebar.

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py: Set the insensitive base color after
	realizing for Firewire. Same trick for Summary.

	* flumotion/admin/gtk/wizard.py: Set the insensitive base, not the
	normal base.

	* data/glade/wizard_summary.py: Use a GtkTextView instead of a
	label for the summary text -- allows the text to reflow according
	to the window size.

	* data/glade/wizard_firewire.py: Set to insensitive so as to
	disallow selection.

	  change logging format again

2005-02-01  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* flumotion/test/test_wizard.py: Make sure Firewire is ready to be
	tested, and avoid the fgtk tests with it -- we don't use them yet.
	All in all, an evil patch.

	* flumotion/worker/checks/video.py (do_element_check): Reworked so
	as to go ahead and do the check instead of returning a thunk.
	Optionally go to a state higher than READY. If the check_proc
	returns a Deferred, don't set the pipeline to NULL (the check_proc
	becomes responsible for it). Handle Deferred returns properly.
	(check1394): Adapted to check the width and height of the video.
	An interesting example, because it uses twisted's scheduling to
	iterate the pipeline until it has caps.

	* flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py (FeedComponent.__init__):
	Add some debugging.
	(ParseLaunchComponent.setup_pipeline): Raise an error with the
	proper arg.

	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.xml: Add
	scaled_width and is_square component properties.

	* flumotion/component/producers/firewire/firewire.py
	(createComponent): Adapt to allow for setting the pixel aspect
	ratio and padding the video size.

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py (FireWire): Reworked to detect the
	size of the output, add option for setting square pixels, contrain
	the aspect ratio, and provide a width correction method.

	* flumotion/wizard/wizard.py (Wizard.error_dialog): fixed long
	line.
	(Wizard.get_step_state): Removed, just use step::get_state().
	(Wizard._sidebar_clean): Don't set the default size of the vbox,
	we set it in the glade file.

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py
	* flumotion/wizard/wizard.py
	(WizardStep.get_component_properties): Made to be a simple wrapper
	around ::get_state(). All steps changed to implement get_state().

	* flumotion/twisted/Makefile.am: Added gtk2reactor.py.

	* flumotion/twisted/gtk2reactor.py: New file, branched from
	twisted's gtk2reactor. Avoids deprecated functions, and some
	pychecker errors fixed. To remove when twisted 2.0 comes out.

	* flumotion/worker/worker.py
	* flumotion/worker/config.py
	* flumotion/manager/component.py
	* flumotion/component/consumers/disker/disker.py

	* flumotion/common/enum.py
	* flumotion/wizard/save.py

	s/is not None/!= None/ to avoid pychecker warnings with python
	2.4.

	* data/glade/wizard.glade: Instead of restricting the content area
	to a certain size, give the window a default size. This allows it
	to expand as necessary.

	* data/glade/wizard_firewire.glade: UI rework. I'm still not
	happy. The width correction should be factored out into a filter.

	* bin/flumotion-admin.in: Use flumotion.twisted.gtk2reactor so as
	to avoid deprecated code.

2005-01-31  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	gstreamer checks that used to be in wizard.steps. Uses a nifty
	procedural abstraction, make_element_checker.

	* flumotion/worker/checks/package.xml: New file, registers
	flumotion.worker.checks.video as a bundle.

	* flumotion/worker/checks/__init__.py: New file, placates python.

	AdminModel's workerRun.

	* flumotion/wizard/steps.py: Move gstreamer checks to

	(BundleLoader): New class, implements a module loader that makes
	sure we run the latest version of a module. Will fetch and install
	bundles as needed.

	* flumotion/admin/admin.py (AdminModel.workerRun): Instead of
	taking a function object, and passing the source of the function
	to the worker, pass a module name and function name to the worker.

	when the run is finished. Make sure we aren't run twice.
